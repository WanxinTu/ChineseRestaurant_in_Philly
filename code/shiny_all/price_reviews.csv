My boyfriend eats for two and it was enough food for both of us (3 stomachs lol), with only some greens leftover. It was a bit pricey ($80 after tax and tip) but I think it was well worth it. I can't really tell the difference between wagyu beef and regular beef, both the broth was so flavorful I really didn't need to dip it in any sauce. The restaurant also provided their house sauce, which was something I'd never had (soy sauce with orange maybe?). I think they said that they hand pull their own noodles or create them with different roots (e.g., taro, green tea?). Another table got a seafood combo and it looked so beautiful.

While you still feel v fancy eating there, most of the things are fairly priced. They suggest you split things family style too so if that's your thing it helps some.

We were able to select as many items as we wanted from a large variety of meats, fish and vegetables. There were also options for noodles, or rice. For broths, we ordered half bone marrow and half spicy. We ordered spinach, skinny mushrooms, broccoli, potatoes, tomatoes, corn, water cresses, sliced beef, sliced pork, shrimp, fishballs and fish dumplings. We got vermicelli, udon noodles and rice. That was a lot of food, but we were hungry and ate all of it! 

The marrow broth needed a bit of salt, but there's an awesome condiment/sauce bar which has salt, so we added some and it was delicious. The spicy broth was good but really really spicy, especially if you drank the broth like soup. However, it was perfect if you were just heating food in the broth and taking it out of the broth.

Apps: Dan dan noodles are hands down a MUST - so much flavor, easy to share.

While from the outside it may be hard to get a sense of what the focus of the restaurant is, they do great soup dumplings as well as Taiwanese rice dishes and other entrees.

Of course, we had to start with an order of their soup dumplings, which were fresh and super tasty, and the wrapping was just thick enough to not burst. The pan fried dumplings were also meaty and good. For our entrees we got a bunch of rice entrees dishes: Taiwanese popcorn chicken, garlic eggplant, shredded pork with bean curd and hot pepper, fish filet with bok choy. The popcorn chicken was crispy with that just right mix of savory and sweet. The pork, bean curd (tofu), and hot pepper was savory with a flavor that really soaked into the tofu, and the eggplant had a awesome, thick, garlicky savory sauce. The least interesting was the fish filet in a mild white sauce, which was good but the fish in chili sauce probably would've tasted better.

All in all, it's nice to have a place that does great soup dumplings as well as other Taiwanese dishes.

First the broth pot arrives, we selected 3 style broth pot (kimchi, original, spicy - all was a bit bland, but did its job of cooking the food) and some small sides. Which was a combination of nuts, cold edamame, and seaweed salad (which was bad cause it had a sour taste to it, probably due to it sitting out and not being refrigerated - i spat out the bite i took). The food comes quickly and i start cooking. The beef was frozen, really frozen, to the point where it stuck to the plate (i know they're suppose to be, but it was to the point of beyond freezer burn and was chewy when done).

The service was fine, what you might expect at Chinese restaurants (you don't go to Chinese restaurants for their warm and friendly service typically). 
We ended up coming here because we were going to grab a small bite to eat for a light dinner. I wanted to get the pad thai from the Little Thai Market, but since we came closer to the closing of Reading Terminal Market, they were all out.
Suddenly, not being prepared for this sort of rejection we walk around the corner and see Shanghai Gourmet Chinese Restaurant. We were both craving Asian cuisine, so it looked like a possibility. While we were skimming over the menu, my husband saw that they had pad thai on the menu so we looked at some reviews and saw how it was not traditional at all. I just wanted some rice noodles with veggies and meat so I was not really reading the reviews too seriously. 
I decided to go for it, not heeding any warnings, and I got the pad thai and my husband got pork fried rice. To be honest, it really is far from pad thai and any variation of it.. The only thing that was similar between ""normal"" pad thai and the one here was that they both use rice noodles and meat (if you so choose). They used vegetables that I think they have on hand and that they frequently use in other dishes. These included: green bell peppers (maybe also red), carrots, and big chunks of onions. They did have bean sprouts though which is normal in pad thai as well as a sprinkling of peanut dust. Something I really did enjoy though was that there was both shrimp and chicken in the dish and it was a good amount too. Now, onto the actual flavor of the dish, as many have pointed out it doesn't really taste like pad thai at all. It wasn't very spicy but I could see how others may not be used to spice at all in pad thai especially if given the choice or option. The flavor was reminiscent of curry similar to Singapore mei fun. If they had substituted the rice noodles for the thin vermicelli noodles it would be a delicious variation of Singapore mei fun. Having said that, you can imagine that curry flavor and pad thai don't really belong together. I still thought it was delicious and enjoyed it, but I would not call it pad thai. Another down side was finding a hair in my food... It really doesn't bother me as much as some people, but if it had been someone else to find that hair I know that they probably wouldn't have let it go. 
I tried some of my husband's pork fried rice and I really liked the wok flavor of the rice. I thought it was delicious. Price-wise, Shanghai Gourmet is not too bad, but they don't accept card for anything under $8 so expect to use cash if it's less than that or spend more to get to the minimum.  
If you're looking for a place with an entirely ""authentic"" or ""traditional"" menu, I wouldn't go with super high expectations. If you wanted really legit Chinese food, I don't think you'd be at Reading anyway with Chinatown being so close. I still think you will be able to have a somewhat enjoyable meal, but if you're at Reading because of the hype of certain restaurants, I would probably stick to those places instead.",Shanghai Gourmet Chinese Restaurant,19107,"{'GoodForKids': 'True', 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': 'False', 'RestaurantsReservations': 'False', 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '1', 'RestaurantsDelivery': 'False', 'BusinessParking': ""{'garage': True, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}"", 'RestaurantsAttire': ""u'casual'"", 'WiFi': ""'no'"", 'Alcohol': ""'none'"", 'RestaurantsTakeOut': 'True', 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'Ambience': ""{'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': True}"", 'NoiseLevel': ""u'loud'"", 'HasTV': 'False', 'BikeParking': 'False', 'GoodForMeal': ""{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': False, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}"", 'OutdoorSeating': 'False', 'Caters': 'True'}","Chinese, Restaurants",0.16394457245263694,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Shanghai Gourmet Chinese Restaurant,19107,Center,0.16394457245263694,0.9966,0.16394457245263694

Wanton soup: For the ($2.75)price, you get a decent portion while dining in. The broth was very flavorful. It wasn't just full of salt and water. They had fresh cabbage or whatever that was in the soup. The wontons themselves were plump, fresh and firm. There wasn't any oil in this soup that I know of. I would like to say this might be one of my favorite wanton soups that I have ever tried. So 5/5 stars here.

Steamed dumplings: I asked her to bring out a couple of sauces to dip the dumplings in. I was assuming they wouldn't have much flavor without chili sauce added. I was wrong, they were actually pretty good without anything added to them. I thought the pork was seasoned well and they were generous with the amount they placed in each dumpling. The only issue was.. how much oil they coated these bad boys with. Holy hell, why must oil be added to everything? The piece of cabbage that the dumplings were resting on was covered in this slimy substance. 3/5 stars 

Spicy Szechuan chicken: okay, so this is where I struggled. I found the chicken to be very moist, it wasn't over cooked. The portion size was, eh, meh, nothing to write about. It's priced a little high for what you actually get. All of the veggies were fresh and cooked extremely well. Their mushrooms A+ 

Here's what ruined it.. the oil. I didn't realize how much oil was actually in this dish until I came home and ate a couple of bites. I wasn't able to eat it in the restaurant because my stomach started to hurt from the oil in the dumplings. 

Oh. My. Gosh. I'm physically in a lot of pain from eating this dish. I don't have a gallbladder, so oily foods do not sit well with me. As time goes on, it's actually getting worse. I find myself wanting to take another star off just because of the amount of pain I am in. 

Would I recommend this place? Eh, ya, I would. They have a nice ambience. Chestnut Hill isn't exactly the best place to go out to dinner, even though some people think it's the bees knees.

We ordered several variations of noodles and appetizers, and one guest even opted to order fried rice. I can say for myself that the duck shaved noodles were delicious when I had them - the meat was not tough, the broth was not too salty, and the noodles were the perfect texture.

The lamb skewers were reminiscent of the dollar carts back in Flushing, NY- well spiced and aromatic. We also ordered some scallion pancakes, steamed dumplings, and fried dumplings. I have to say that the scallion pancakes were a bit smaller in portion than I'd have liked, but they were still good. The sauce for the steamed and fried dumplings were different, though I favored the fried dumplings themselves, the sauce for the steamed was much more interesting.

1. Excellent broth. We tried the tomato based soup, Tonkatsu miso, and spicy. The tomato and spicy ones we're very flavorful. 

2. Attentive staff. Brandon was very sweet and interactive if you enjoy the small talks. 

3. Meat and veggies are super fresh and the cuts are great. They offer Wagyu beef. It just melts in your mouth. 

4. Large variety of meat and vegetables to choose from. We got the meat combo, veggie combo, and noodle combo- heads up: these combos are pretty small so it feeds about two people if you're not trying to get full- this is a con I guess. 

Cons: 

1. Proportions we're smaller for the price tag so you do rack up the bill pretty quickly.

2. We tried the wagyu uni nigiri and wagyu beef tongue uni nigiri. They're $18 for two piece , which was good to try once.. haha but I would not order again. If you're choosing between these two, go with the beef tongue. It's soft and flavorful. 

Would we come back? Probably for the broth.

On a Sat brunch time it was busy which was reassuring so that food would be fresh.  They have all the essentials shumai, hakgow and roast pork buns.  My favorites are the fried almond bun with roast pork buns.  They also have lots of flat noodles with shrimp or beef.  The congee is just ok not great.  The service is better than most other dimsum places.  Prices are reasonable.  There is also free parking in the lot.

And walking into Xun Yu Si Kao, from the moment the smells hit to seeing all the dishes come out, we knew we'd be in for a good dinner. Once you open up the menu you'll be pleasantly surprised by how all the dishes have pictures, and while the initial lay out of the menu may not be super intuitive, it is nice to just point at what looks good and ask your server for that. We opted for their signature fish pot, along with stir fry intestines and ma po tofu. The intestines were some of the best I've had; great texture and savory and spicy sauce made me crave more with each bite.

Shallow Fish pot is a little bit pricey but ultimately delicious; your starting fish are $40 but you add veggies and carbs to it so that it bathes in the sauce and gives you a savory, spicy, altogether tasty combo that you will want spooning over your rice for days. As a default, just go ahead and order the $5 veggie combo(with enoki, seaweed, and sliced potatoes), and then throw in whatever else makes you happy. We liked glass noodles, black fungus, but you can really customize as you wish. Everything is cooked nicely and the grill they serve it on keeps everything nice and warm throughout your dinner; the sauce is delicious enough that we packed it home afterwards just to throw in more vegetables and replicate the meal the next day. 

Overall, a bit pricier than most Chinatown establishments, but the quality is worth it, the place is clean, and they also do a surprisingly good job with the presentation of their dishes.

Sodas and other beverages come at an additional price.

We got a small dessert of free ice cream for checking in on Yelp and writing a review - although we wished a small dessert could be included routinely with the all-you-can-eat price. 

Altogether with tax & tip, our bill was ~$30/pp, very affordable for what we got. We plan to be back soon!

So I thought I'd try the one in Manayunk, after all, it's a bit closer. What a mistake. First, there is no sound deadening material in the restaurant. With only two tables having conversations at a moderate volume, it was unbearably loud -- something that would have been no issue at all with some sound deadening. 

The plates were cheap, as well as the Coca-Cola cups. Which is fine, on its own, but they are much nicer in the location I usually go to, and there's no discernible price difference on the menu.

I ordered exactly what I order at the Han Dynasty by UPenn, and I was rather disappointed. The main dishes -- the Scallion Style Chicken and the Garlic Sauce Chicken -- were not as good. Our appetizers -- the scallion pancakes and the dumplings in chili oil -- were half as good. Frankly, they were mediocre. All of this I would consider amazing at the other location.

My bf and I wanted to try something different since the menu is pretty big. Everything we ate tonight was delicious, but the food we ordered the first time was way better. Tonight we ordered the pork wonton in chili oil, steamed shrimp and vegetable dumplings, sautéed seafood noodles and diced chicken w/hot pepper. The pork wonton was good, but the chili oil wasn't what we expected. It had a nice kick to it and also a strong peanut taste. The sauce was good and I wish I could've saved some because it would've been good with noodles, rice or anything really. Strong peanut taste so if you're not about it maybe skip this dish. We both agreed that the shrimp and vegetable dumplings was the best thing we had tonight. It was so good!! Sautéed seafood noodles was nice because they were very generous with the assortment of seafood, BUT drunken noodles was 100% better. Seafood noodles were very wet drenched in sauce and was nothing mind blowing. The drunken noodles w/shrimp was out of this world and we also just prefer the wide noodles. Diced chicken was good, but also wasn't something we expected. It was a bit overpriced compared to everything else on their menu. $14 for the entree and 50% was all hot pepper flakes and 50% was small fried popcorn chicken. Tasty but we both dipped it in the dumpling sauce because it was fried and needed a tad bit more flavor. Everything was still delicious, but the food we ordered the first time was way better.

Unfortunately, that was where our experience cratered. 

We stopped in for late lunch around 3 when part of the menu shifted from lunch to dinner prices. As all ordering is done online even when sitting in the restaurant, it made for some confusion in both ordering and paying. To make matters worse, there were two menus - a paper menu on the tables and a very different online ordering menu, that were not well coordinated. 

So, while we wanted and thought we ordered beef soup with dumplings; what we got was just poorly crafted dumplings with thick skin and low flavor. Disappointing. Beyond that, the Vietnamese style spring rolls @$3.95 for twins, was mostly cabbage within. Double whammy!  Finally, the beef sandwich was basically a soft scallion pancake rolled up with ""meat"" inside and a squirt of hoisin sauce for sweetener. While the best of the bunch, it left alot to be desired. 

No doubt this Boom Buns is primarily a takeout joint, and customers are far away when they open the bag and see what they got (BOOM!) For those of us eating in house, the sound of deflated expectations created a rumbling crash in our stomachs (BOOM)! 

Maybe the Xao Long Bao is the way to go here, but we'll never know, because a return visit is just not in the cards. There is too much competition in this growing Asian neighborhood for anyone to give Boom Buns a second try.

It's indoors with lots of food options: hot cooked to order, pre-made, baked goods, juice places, bakery items, fresh made baked goods, confectioners, smoothies, etc, etc. Some of the small restaurants have seats (from a couple of bar stools up to 15-20 seats). There's also common food court seating, although it was mostly full when I was there.

It could be chaos, but it's actually laid out pretty well, with a number of entrances, and enough division between establishments that it doesn't feel like a street market.

I sampled from 4-5 places (that's all my stomach could take). ALL were decent, and honestly surprisingly well-priced for the city center of a major metropolis. If I lived or worked nearby, I'd be in here regularly.

There's also one or more places offering a butcher, fishmonger, florists, produce, and a variety of knicknacks and home goods. It's a complete market, and that's though I probably missed a quarter of what was on offer.

At this point (June 2021) the majority of the market was open but masks were required inside. A handful of empty or vacated spots implied places that didn't make it... but the vast majority of the place was not just operating, but bustling.

There's one sour spot-- closing time is 6pm (when I was there), which is awfully early for the dinner or commuter crowd. I don't know if that's normal here, or a covid effect.

From poor service to barely edible food, this establishment's attempts to put a spin on Asian cuisine is flawed in every possible way. 

We had a reservation at 9:15 pm on a Friday. I know, tragic. The entrance was crowded and 6 hostess' stood behind their stand taking directions from one. We came in at 9:10 pm & was told our table was ready and they'd seat us shortly. By 9:40, after standing around and getting bumped into by every other hostess we were finally seated. So much for reservations - sigh. 

Our server was kind but skeptical to even serve us food. Three Asian girls amongst a restaurant full of patrons who believed that this establishment's cuisine is SO delish. 

We tried the following: 

Tuna Tartare Spring Rolls ($16): 3 tiny deep fried spring rolls stuffed with a cold tuna tartare. This, although overly priced was the only edible shared plate we all could eat without downing wine or water to muddle the taste. 

Crispy Calamari Salad ($24): An over powering sweet miso dressing is tossed with tiny chopped up pieces of romaine lettuce & red cabbage & overly salted & super oily, deep fried calamari. I questioned every time I chomped on a lettuce if it was water or oil. Who knows. 

Dim Sum Sampler ($21): Honestly, it's just terrible dumplings in a dim sum container. Yikes. The pork dumpling I had was dowsed in soy sauce and over powered the meat so I can't say what it actually tasted like, but I know it was so salty I gulped down a whole glass of water. The ""popular"" edamame dumplings were mixed with all kinds of ricotta cheese and whatnot, making it unpleasantly fatty, mushy and gross. The shrimp dumpling had an odd cold center. 

Black Pepper Beef ($30): No one at the table could eat this bc it was so, overly salty even after downing two glasses of wine. I wouldn't want to know what this tasted like sober. We asked for medium and some of the meat was rare inside. To top it off, the only to make it partially edible was to cut off the sides of the meat that was SO overly drowned in some sort of play on Chinese take out Black Pepper Steak sauce, gone wrong. 

Shrimp Lo Mein ($23): Cellophane like noodles mixed with a, you guessed it, OVERLY salty sauce. This dish was destroyed before it had a chance to survive. I wish they had used the lo mein noodles bc it would have probably made the dish a bit less salty. 


We couldn't necessarily make comments to our server as for some reason, he was never around.. yikes. 

Think of Buddakan as Chinese take out gone wrong, placed in an over priced restaurant. I highly do not recommend.

We were originally going to plan my dad's surprise birthday party at Tango, but after messing up our reservation, Lair KTV became an option for us and I am glad that it did! 

Linda was kind enough to let us leave party decorations earlier than our reservation so we can set it up for later since it was a surprise party. 

We reserved the room good for 20 people, which was true to size. They were pretty strict with ID's upon entry, so make sure your guests are 21+ :) 

There were three huge screens and two mics available and it was perfect. The song selections were pretty nice and had a pretty big range. It seems almost up-to-date. It was very easy to navigate and look for songs. Everybody definitely sang their hearts out. 

Room service was great! Everytime we rang they came in at a timely manner to serve us.  Staff was so nice. I can't remember everyone's name but I believe David, Linda, and Sandy were a whole lot of help to us! 

The food was awesome! We ordered calamari, French fries, steamed shrimp dumplings, beef chow fun, and crispy chicken wings. They came pretty fast too. They also let us bring in our own cake and they were nice enough to store it for us until it was ready to serve. 

We also ordered cases of beer so I like that they have this option.

PROS: You come for essentially 2 things: the novelty of the whole idea of ""conveyor belt hot pot"" and the wagyu beef. Literally that's it. Granted the beef is probably one of the better hot pot meat I've had in all my years of eating hot pot. It's pretty soft and melts in your mouth. Tastes better if you dip it into their house made yuzu sauce thing (which by the way was the star of the meal). The convenience of the whole thing is pretty great: you see an item you want on the belt and you take it. Our waiter was also an absolute gem. So nice and really attentive. The whole thing is definitely a fun thing to do maybe like...once.

CONS: Where do I even begin. For starters, they don't got a sauce bar. The waiter will come around with this big tray of sauces and you take from that. Then they take it away. So basically, you either leave that thing on your table and have it take up literally 75% of the space on your table or you let the waiter take it back and are sauceless halfway through your meal if you don't make enough. We also ordered some pork belly with our wagyu and that thing came in the most pathetic little slices. Like so small and so thin that you can't taste nothing after you put it in your pot. To be honest, I lost half of them in there. They also don't tell you what items are gonna be on the conveyor belt. When we went, we basically saw the same couple of items being offered on it (mainly fish balls and veggies with a few spams, tofus, and eggs). You can still order items from the menu but it'd be helpful to have some kind of like ""conveyor belt"" list of items or something to let you know what'll be on it so you can plan out what you order a la carte. Let me also just say that even when you order a la carte, the portion sizes vary from too much (they gave us a whole butt load of quail eggs) to LITERALLY NOTHING. Don't judge me but I actually counted how many strands of potato noodles we got cause it looked really empty in the bowl. THERE WAS ONLY LIKE 12 STRANDS! 12 STRANDS! EXCUSE ME???And lord have mercy...THE PRICE. IT AINT WORTH IT PEOPLE. It's really not. My husband and I ate less than what we usually eat at Little Sheep and had to pay MORE. Besides the wagyu beef, everything else didn't taste any different from another hot pot place in Chinatown so essentially, you're paying more to eat the same food but a lesser portion. Their stock was also...mildly flavored at best.

Our starting spot in line was where the ramp ends and it was about a half hour wait (this was on a Thursday night at 7 pm). Even though this place is called Dim Sum garden, we didn't order any Cantonese styled dim sum and instead opted for their Shanghai dishes. You'll see from the items we ordered we went kind of overkill on the carbs... Don't know if it was because we were starving but every single item we ordered was amazing. Their prices are also very affordable; we paid about 20 bucks per person and had lots of leftovers. Highly recommend coming here! 

1. Shanghai steamed pork soup dumpling
4.5/5
Yes I agree that these were comparable to the soup dumplings at Din Tai Fung and each soup dumpling had lots of soup in them. There soup dumplings were also bigger than the typical size. 

2. Shanghai pan fried pork soup dumpling
5/5
This was one of the best versions of this I've had (second only to an amazing place in LA)--the pan fried skin is super crispy, the pork is tender, and lots of good soup. Best item we ordered, and when you look around the restaurant you'll see that literally every table has ordered a plate of these!

3. Pork with sauce noodle
5/5
This item was ordered on a whim (we literally only ordered it because there was a picture of it in the menu so we figured it had to be good) and luckily it was! Noodles were perfect texture and the brown sauce is slightly sweet. Solid version of the popular Shanghai dish.

4. Sliced pork with garlic sauce
4.5/5
Comes with a bowl of rice which made it easier to finish. The pork was very tender with a sweet and tangy glazed sauce. 

5. Scallion pancake
4/5

We got the booth in the very far right of the restaurant and I literally could not sit in the seat away from the door. There was no space between the wall where the seat was pressed against and the hot pot table. I had to switch seats with my girlfriend because I actually couldn't get in so I don't know how thats allowed to be a seat. Also, you are technically supposed be able to fit 4 in that booth. 

Also, instead of a big hot pot in the middle everyone gets a personal pot which I didn't like but that was just a stylistic thing. Finally the price adds up but I'd say it was worth it. 

The beef combo is for sure the move. It was like 25 bucks for 16 oz of really good cuts of beef. It tasted like nothing else I've ever had before. We got two broths, the tonkotsu which was the best hot pot broth i've ever had an the entry level hellish spicy broth. Entry level still had a good kick to it. Udon noodles were great, nice and chewy but the real star were the rice cakes. It was sort of like korean Ddukbokki but shaped differently.

I was in town visiting friends and we planned to hit Happy Hour once I got to town. They both had been before and said that they were a good place to go. 

Happy Hour is at the bar only, so if you want to go, be sure to come early when they open (at like 4PM) so you won't be stuck waiting. We arrived around 4:15ish, and when we left at 5:15 there were a lot of people waiting to be seated. 

The most that you'll pay for a food item is $5. I wasn't really intrigued by any of the happy hour drinks that day, so I just got a glass of Chardonnay. 

To eat, I had the Crab Rangoons, Kimchee Fried Rice, and Chicken Bao Buns. All three were delicious, but my favorite of the three was the kimchee fried rice. You get a GREAT portion for the price, and I had some leftover for the next day. I did not get the chili sauce that came on the chicken Bao bun and opted for extra ranch instead.

The place that really made Stephen Starr the success he is; this was the first really higher end Stephen Starr restaurant, and when it was open, it was among the first on the East Coast with Asian style fusion (mid 1990s). The problem is just many more Asian restaurants exist in Philly for lower prices (not with the same style), so the impact is just not the same when entrees are commonly $30+ a plate, given the other options. It still seems pretty busy with the tourist crowd though. Desserts are really good, as are some of the foods (try spare ribs).

Bento lunch is also a pretty good deal ($15 or $20, depending on selection). But overall, this is a poor facsimile as to what it was in the past. Not really recommended.

I was in town visiting friends and we planned to hit Happy Hour once I got to town. They both had been before and said that they were a good place to go. 

Happy Hour is at the bar only, so if you want to go, be sure to come early when they open (at like 4PM) so you won't be stuck waiting. We arrived around 4:15ish, and when we left at 5:15 there were a lot of people waiting to be seated. 

The most that you'll pay for a food item is $5. I wasn't really intrigued by any of the happy hour drinks that day, so I just got a glass of Chardonnay. 

To eat, I had the Crab Rangoons, Kimchee Fried Rice, and Chicken Bao Buns. All three were delicious, but my favorite of the three was the kimchee fried rice. You get a GREAT portion for the price, and I had some leftover for the next day. I did not get the chili sauce that came on the chicken Bao bun and opted for extra ranch instead.

I've been through many dietary changes and I always found something I am happy with. Overall, it's traditional, buzzing at almost all times, and quite delicious. One of my favorite spots to take out of town visitors.

Location: Heart of Chinatown on Race. Restaurant is always clean. Cash only, ATM in the lobby. They will seat you very close to other parties or at tables with others when it is busy. Just ask your neighbor for the condiment caddy and share the love. Recently upgraded their menu appearance, but no noticeable changes to the actual content of the menu. 

Food: Two varieties of noodles, hand drawn and shaved. Pho is huge and they do have a mushroom based broth for vegan/vegetarian folks--but you have to ask for it.

I've always had my go to staples in Chinatown, but was invited to Tai Lake by my parents for dinner so I happily went along. I know some Chinatown restaurants can be hit or miss so my expectations weren't that high.

I was pleasantly surprised at the food. Real and authentic (as it should be in Chinatown). We had a large party of 12 so we had a bunch of dishes family style to share. We had a little bit of everything - lobster, fish, fried rice, and the works. Everything was great (food 5/5).

Service was also top notch from a normal take your order, server your food, check on you standpoint..

However, we were on the second floor and there was without a doubt that the servers use the second floor bathroom for their smoke break (it's a small, personalized style bathroom with one toilet). It was one of the coldest days of the year so it was probably a combination of the weather and having to go all the way to the first floor. The bathroom reeked of cigarette smoke and, as anyone knows, smell and taste go hand in hand. It really made the food taste different. Unfortunate (service 2/5).

Ambiance is like any normal Chinatown restaurant (ambiance 3/5). 

Drinks were fairly priced with a limited selection (3/5).",Tai Lake Restaurant,19107,"{'Corkage': 'False', 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '2', 'Alcohol': ""u'full_bar'"", 'WiFi': ""u'no'"", 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': 'True', 'OutdoorSeating': 'False', 'RestaurantsTakeOut': 'True', 'GoodForKids': 'True', 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'RestaurantsReservations': 'True', 'Ambience': ""{'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'classy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': True}"", 'RestaurantsAttire': ""'casual'"", 'BikeParking': 'True', 'BYOBCorkage': ""'yes_free'"", 'Caters': 'True', 'NoiseLevel': ""'average'"", 'BusinessParking': ""{'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}"", 'HasTV': 'True', 'GoodForMeal': ""{'dessert': False, 'latenight': True, 'lunch': None, 'dinner': True, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}"", 'RestaurantsDelivery': 'True'}","Chinese, Noodles, Restaurants, Seafood",0.19009199134199137,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Tai Lake Restaurant,19107,Center,0.19009199134199137,0.9865,0.19009199134199137

They offer typical Chinese dishes and your lunch combo type meals on their menu. I'd say that style of food is average here, given how many places in Chinatown have dumplings and scallion pancakes. 

I ordered their hot pot style dish, where you can pick out what you want on a piece of paper, mark it down and get a very large dish with everything ordered. It's supposed to be hot pot without the hot pot. The concept was slightly confusing, but essentially you have to pick enough ingredients to hit the minimum price for a hot pot or dry pot. I did the dry pot so it was $15. It wasn't hard to hit and the portion size is definitely meant to be shared (which I didn't realize and ordered all for myself lol). I got it a little bit spiced. 

My noodles and veggies came out soaked, literally soaked, in the hot pot spicy chili oil, and I was not really satisfied with it. It was way too much oil, too spicy and way over cooked.

If you want to earn more as restaurant, then you should improve your service, not cut costs by limiting the customer's options. Luckily we had enough cash with us.

FOOD: we ordered the dim sum sampler, black pepper beef, snow peas, and dan dan noodles. I personally think that fusion food should seek to elevate traditional food, instead of arbitrarily combining elements. Buddakan attempts it with varying success. The dan dan noodles, at a pricey $16, incorporated chickpeas and not much else. It tasted like ordinary dan dan with chickpeas. 2/5. The black pepper beef was very non traditional, with hunks of ribeye cooked medium rare- 3.5/5, it was quite salty. The snow peas were actually the star: bacon went super well in the dish, making it a great example of good, purposeful fusion. 4.5/5. Dim sum sampler was a mixed bag- the edamame dumplings were interesting, but the pork ones were super salty and objectively not great. 2.5/5. 

The dessert was fantastic: got a poached pear. I think this one was successful because the fusion wasn't really attempted, and therefore the flavors felt much more cohesive. Came with gold foil on top too :) 

SERVICE: excellent! Our waitress was kind and knowledgeable. One qualm is that she didn't tell us that the bottled water would be extra ($6 to be exact) - I suppose if it's an upscale place it's to be expected? There's also coat check, which is nice in cold Philly.

I'd classify it as Chinese-American food (vaguely Cantonese, but is designed to appeal primarily to Americans) and as competitive in quality with similar types of restaurants in Chinatown such as Lee How Fook. Food is not hugely seasoned (although by Cantonese standards, it is rather spicy, so spicier dishes here are fine), but is prepared very elegantly, and has a very clean taste to it. Fairly quiet in general. Pricing is quite affordable. Lots of good food options. I do worry a bit about it becoming a relic similar to places such as Imperial Inn and some others that are more along this style. Consistency is very strong; I always know what quality I'm getting when I am  here,which is definitely a plus.

I usually will get one appetizer, some sort of veggie dish, and some sort of meat dish (or fried rice dish).

Options my family and I have liked are below (honestly most of the menu is good though):

Apps: Dumplings (Steamed or fried-$8), stuffed eggplant ($8)

Soup: Curry Beef Soup ($8 for two people), Wonton ($4), Chicken and Corn ($4)

Veggies: Mustard Greens ($10), Mixed Greens ($10), Tofu with Vegetables ($10, Snow Pea Leaves ($14)

Beef and Lamb: Lamb Chops ($19), Hunan Style Beef ($17)

Poultry: General's ($15), Duck Special ($21), Chicken with Shitake Mushrooms ($15)

Seafood: Steamed Salmon ($16), Steamed Tilapia ($16), Fish of the Day

I've been to hotpot places before, but never have I seen this type of variety of food for cooking, a conveyor belt AND tasted this kind of flavor!! I've also never seen a pot for each person! This place is the coolest!! 

 I loved concocting my own sauce with a ponzu base they give you at the beginning of the meal. I added garlic, scallions, crushed peanuts, sesame oil and hot chili oil. This added to their vegan mushroom broth was complex and totally outrageous!! 

My fam also ordered the other vegan broth, which was a creamy tomato and hubs ordered the 'Hellfire' in entry spiciness, and even that was quite hard to handle. Watch the spice level, you could easily just add chili oil if you need more kick. Each broth came with some added veggies and seasoning. 

So this is the only hot pot place in the world with A5 quality wagyu beef. They take their meat VERY seriously here. Hubs enjoyed his thin sliced angus brisket and huge tiger shrimp thoroughly. There's some crazy stuff on the menu like duck flippers and beef throat, which admittedly freaked me out a bit. 

Fellow veg-heads, fear not however, there's a TON of options for us!! For instance, their beautiful mixed mushroom basket that blew my mind. Also there's more than 4 types of tofu and over a dozen noodles including green tea, sweet potato, purple yam aka ube. Needle, glass, wide potato...and so on.  

They only take reservations for parties of 6 or more and the wait on a Saturday night can be well over an hour. You can however just check in via iPad at the entrance and stroll Chinatown a bit until they text you! We somehow got super lucky during Lunar New Year festivities and wound up with only 3 parties ahead of us. 

Enjoy B1G1 conveyor belt dishes during Happy Hour 9:30-11:30pm M-F and one free conveyor belt item with Yelp check-in. 

*Be sure to check the belt as bok choy, tofu, some mushrooms and shrimp are on there and are $1 or so less expensive. 

Kids broth is half price. My 7 & 9 year old got a kick out of everything. Def bring the (bigger)kids!

I'm quite impressed with quality, the portion sizes, the powerful flavor, the over all cool vibes, the beautiful presentation, the vegan options, and the option to make your meal as health conscious as you choose! I'm now a huge fan, as is the entire fam! We will definitely be back soon! I want this at my house for everyday consumption!!

A) I make a reservation somewhere nice in Center City or adjacent.
B) Let's go somewhere closer to home?
C) Are you really sure you wanna go there?
D) What about this place (that at least one of us isn't into)
E) Takeout?

This always happens - we've spent our entire fall/winter going from our Birthdays to our wedding anniversary to the Holidays to the anniversary of our first date to...Valentine's day.  For us, it's the end of a long run of Holidays and is the least special.  So, inevitable and for like 8 years now, we get takeout.

Enter Xi'an Sizzling Woks, which was conveniently on our way home from some earlier day errands.  As a result, this is a takeout only review, but given Xi'an's proximity to college students, should be useful.

Xi'an is a slightly modern, fairly Americanized spin on traditional Szechuan cuisine in the US.  I've read on Phillymag that Xi'an features a lot of Shaanxi specialities, which ""shares a border--and occasional outbursts of chili heat--with Szechuan its southern neighbor, but westward influences loom large in its cooking."" (https://www.phillymag.com/articles/2013/10/25/philadelphia-restaurant-review-xian-sizzling-woks/#XMqZbRofStTM52l5.99).

While I found the heat slightly lacking, it still had a little more spice than maybe some are used to and I'm sure you could ask them to turn up the heat (I will next time).

Pros:

Service and the niceness of the staff were great.  They were ready when we got there some 20 minute after ordering.  Friendly and easy to get in and out

The restaurant itself was nice.  For a place the probably resides between the relative niceness of Han Dynasty and your local Chinese joint, Xi'an is a place that feels a step above fast casual and is a little cozy.  I believe we would eat here in the future.

Our food ranged from Average to great.  (See some cons below)

The Duck and Pork buns were leaders of the pack, which deliciously soft bao puns on some well-seasons and slightly sweet duck or pork.  Both were our favorites!  

My wife and I tried the Sauteed Spicy Chicken and Noodle and Pan Fried Spicy Pork for dinner.  The chicken was the star with enjoyable potatoes lumped in - it was well-seasons and a little bit of heat, but a saucy favorite when mixed with the noodles.  The Pork isn't something I'd re-do (with so many great options to try), but we liked it none-the-less.  It lacked the heat of it's compatriot, but was filling and enjoyable.

We still have plenty of leftovers (did we over-order?!), but no matter, chinese leftovers are our favs!

Cons:

The price is arguably slightly higher, but for a comparable Szechuan menu to Han Dynasty, I found the prices on point.  

Our Shanghai Bokchoy with Green Soy Bean was fine, if mostly a steamed mixture of the two - nothing special.  Our Won Ton soup was enjoyable but typical - it features a lighter wonton than less quality establishment that my wife gave a thumbs up.  The Dan Dan noodles were acceptable, if slightly less spicy and saucy than other places we've had.  

Conclusion:  If you're looking for a slightly different spin on typical Chinese-American takeout, you could do much worse than Xi'an Sizzling Woks.  With prices comparable to other less-quality Chinese joints in the area and food which far-outstrips them, Xi'an has typical Chinese-American fare (we spotted Sesame Chicken and boneless spare ribs on the menu, among others) and some more traditional fare which my wife and I have grown to enjoy since becoming more adventurous.

Also, be prepared for a wait. We arrived at 1:15 in the afternoon which we figured was a safe time.  Surprisingly we arrived to an hour and a half wait as we were informed. They do have a good notification system though so at least you can go elsewhere while you wait and they will contact you when they have your table. You have to check in at the door on their iPad though, so no luck calling ahead to skip the wait. 

Service was surprising. Not necessarily surprising good, but a little good and a little bad. Hostess was super nice. 

On the other hand, our actual server was rushed and hardly checked on us at all. Seemed like he wanted to be elsewhere. In 2 to 2.5 hours we spent there (yes that long) he stopped by three times in the first 10 minutes then not once again until we were trying to get a check at which point he returned with his winter coat on and a can of drink in hand. Our two glasses of water were not refilled once the whole time. 

The bussers and non-specific wait staff were all, however much nicer and very good , and since our server never checked in or did anything, so that's a really good thing...so we relied on them to refill our hot pot broth and bring orders (including the ones he forgot, lol). Luckily they did a good job of saving the experience. 

On to the food:

Wagyu nigiri was a treat. really nice meat and good rice.

the rainbow soup dumplings are really yummy too...liked the consumee and the wagyu filling was a nice departure from the traditional pork.

Oxtail tomato broth was the standout between that and the house original.  Although once mixed in my little soup bowl with a spoon of the ponzu and spices, the original woke up very nicely and satisfied.

Ponzu house dipping sauce and all the sauces are really good accompaniments 

No a5 wagyu today which i really wanted to eat so I'm a little disappointed there. The wagyu nigiri was a substitution for the a5 sashimi...it was good but hard to be excited when substituting for a dish i craved. More forgivable if it weren't for the fact that they advertise the a5 as one of the reasons to go there and also more forgivable if our server hadn't talked it up as what i needed to get before coming back to tell me i couldn't have it because they were now out.

Sous vide wagyu tongue was ok but not amazing.  Not worth it. 

House made noodles were very good. The trio on the combo plate were excellent in texture and flavor. 

Tiger shrimp were fresh and good quality. 

Squid rings were decent. 

Watercress was very fresh and tender.

Napa was ok...they could have been a little more selective though and removed the few leaves with black spots. 

Mushrooms were all very fresh and good quality. 

So...why three stars?

Overall a four to five star food experience but a bad server, missing a5 wagyu which they advertise as one of the reasons to go there, and overly high prices made it a three star dining experience instead.

Now that we know how to order here for an optimal experience at a better price, we'll know what and how to order in the future to ensure a four star meal.

The cool, dark and edgy ambience stands out compared to regular Asian fusion restaurants (it kinds of reminds you of Mission in NYC or Morimoto which are on the higher end category -- so Sampan definitely deserves a five-star for even making the comparison). We ordered pork buns, general tso soup dumpling, kimchi fried rice and Sichuan chicken stir fry. The pork buns come with a twist -- it's very crispy outside (which is quite unusual for the pork in buns, although it feel a bit dry) but they definitely get points on this because the middle part of the pork was very tender! The soup dumplings were really good too. My favorite was definitely the kimchi fried rice because it was diverse in flavor that it tasted like a mix of Thai, Indonesian, Chinese and Korean fried rice -- a very inclusive fried rice! The Sichuan chicken stir fry was also very good -- it gave lots of veggies (which amazing)!

The Food:  We ended up getting a feast.  We ordered the scallion pancake ($3.95) and beef tendons in chili oil ($9.95) for appetizers.  The scallion pancake was fairly standard and unremarkable.  The beef tendons in chili oil - my wife was quite proud of how far I've come in terms of openness to different food (I'm at ""level 2 ordering"") - were really good. 
 They are super thin with a little chew, and really soak up the chili oil to make for a fairly spicy dish (it was the spiciest dish we had, although it is not going to come close to the actual spice levels we had in China).  

For entrees, we ordered the dry pot style with pork entree ($15.95) and the crispy rice style with chicken entree ($14.95), as well as the bok choy with black mushrooms ($12.95).  The dry pot style was the star of the show - really bold flavors, and the pork was very tender.  We kept the spice level at 10, which really ended up being only a medium spice level.  But still excellent flavor, and the mini wok it is served in is great presentation (and keeps the dish warm).  The crispy rice style is always fun to eat because the rice has a nice chew to it, and can really soak up the sauce.  It was slightly too sweet for my liking, but the chicken was also very tender and the dish complemented the dry pot style pretty well.  The bok choy with black mushrooms is also a bit of a sweeter dish, but it was cooked well and the mushrooms were plump with great flavor.  We also ended up getting a free cumin style with tofu entree by accident, which ended up being a freebie (who am I to say no?).  The tofu was a bit too dry, but great strong cumin flavor on the dish (and I'm not complaining because we were not charged).  

Service: We had to wait 5 minutes for a table, which made no sense because there were a ton of tables open.  But once we got seated, our server was great.  He also was really nice to box up the leftovers for us (and even threw in some extra rice).  Overall very good service.

My visit resonated all the other reviews. The ingredients were fresh, tasty and is definitely a higher grade above typical hot pot places. The environment is nice cause it doesn't leave you smelling like food like other places and the individual hot pots are nice. However, the prices do add up after making sure everyone was filled and we spent about $60/per person before tips. I didnt care for the fact that they charge you for a soup base even with higher menu prices. The waiter said the combo feeds about 2-3 people, which i dont think is accurate unless you order everyone one of the combos, which we did (and more). Highlights were the beef and seafood combo, which gave you nice quality items, but definitely not too filling. The homemade noodles are delicious also. The rainbow dumplings are definitely very lack luster as i dont think there were any real soup when biting into them, plus you have to put them in the hot pot to cook, which i expected like a regular soup dumpling. 

Overall, its a good place to try for the beef and fresher ingredients, but i'll probably go to another hot pot place in the future.",Chubby Cattle,19107,"{'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'RestaurantsReservations': 'True', 'OutdoorSeating': 'False', 'RestaurantsAttire': ""u'casual'"", 'RestaurantsTakeOut': 'True', 'HappyHour': 'False', 'NoiseLevel': ""u'average'"", 'Ambience': ""{'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'classy': True, 'casual': False}"", 'WiFi': ""u'no'"", 'RestaurantsDelivery': 'True', 'RestaurantsTableService': 'True', 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': 'True', 'HasTV': 'False', 'BusinessParking': ""{'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}"", 'Caters': 'False', 'GoodForMeal': ""{'dessert': True, 'latenight': True, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': True, 'brunch': None, 'breakfast': None}"", 'WheelchairAccessible': 'True', 'DogsAllowed': 'False', 'GoodForKids': 'True', 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '2', 'BikeParking': 'True', 'Alcohol': ""u'beer_and_wine'""}","Restaurants, Bars, Seafood, Japanese, Hot Pot, Nightlife, Chinese, Conveyor Belt Sushi, Mongolian, Asian Fusion",0.17525252525252527,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Chubby Cattle,19107,Center,0.17525252525252527,0.9767,0.17525252525252527

Wait time wasn't long at all for it being a Saturday night- half an hour which with the texting system they have worked out great as we were able to go into a few shops without fear of missing our table. 

The restaurant itself has great decor that feels really clean and new, and the delicious smell of the food when you walk in makes you want to stay to find out how good it tastes. I have to admit at first it was a little intimidating how wide a selection their menu is, especially having no prior experience at a hot pot, but our server, Zoey, couldn't have been more helpful. She explained everything, down to what items are most popular and how we'll actually cook the food. 

We all ordered the same soup base, the tomato oxtail soup, so I can't attest for the other bases but the oxtail was amazing and paired with everything we got perfectly. I highly recommend first timers trying it. 

Next was the meat which was what I looked forward to the most. We ordered cod, the A5 wagyu, chicken, and lamb. The presentation on everything was amazing and unique, with every plate looking tailored specifically to that food item. We also ordered the vegetable combo, pasta combo, and a side of mushrooms and bamboo shoots. Everything came out fresh and ready to cook. 

We didn't wait very long at all for our food and every item was explained in detail how long to prepare. I was amazed at the quality of the meat, and everything tasted amazing. The vegetables in particular were so good paired with the oxtail broth. 

I've never had such a good experience with a restaurant before, it was so cool to cook your own food and it's a meal I'll be craving again soon. Of course, the food is a bit more pricey than other places in the area, but the quality, atmosphere, and experience is worth it.

On Jan 9 2019 I had a big party of 10 people at Sampan for my boyfriends 30th birthday party . Here is the review I left on open table the next day : 

I had a reservation for 7:30pm, however, we weren't seated until 8:15/8:20pm. To me, it's unacceptable. The reservation was for 10 people, and we were sat in a booth which was barely giving us enough elbow room. Mind you, there was an empty table right next to us that was eventually offered to us to spread out- but at the end of our dining experience. The whole evening felt unorganized and lacked professionalism. I have dined here many times and have thoroughly enjoyed myself. Last night was quite the opposite: dishes were mixed up, orders weren't correct, and we were all squished. I don't typically write reviews, but I was celebrating something special, and my evening felt quite the opposite.

So after this was done a manger called my phone left a voicemail stating they saw my review on open table and they would love to speak to me about what had happened . I called the same day and stop to a gentleman explained everything to him . His exact words I am so sorry this happened you and your boyfriend can come in any day just please make a reservation and we will give you a complimentary dinner . So I do not live close to Sampan but my boyfriend loves it when we are in the city so I decided to call yesterday to see if I could set something up for the weekend . I called one at 2:45 spoke to a woman Amanda she transferred me to the restaurant and they keep me on hold for about 5 min and explained to me that management was on a team meeting before the restaurant open and they would call me back, no one called back . I called again at about 4:20 and same female picked up Amanda and she told me they would call me back because they are busy due to serving but I called at 2:45 so that this wouldn't  happened they had a whole hour to call me back and also I explained to them that I just wanted to make sure I was staying around the city because remember I don't live around here , she seemed like she could careless .

I ordered brown rice and when I started to eat it, realized parts of it were crunchy. The sesame chicken had good flavor, but was not crunchy, which is how I prefer it.

A particularly favorable option if you have a group of people with different palettes - there's something for everyone!

I'm not sure of what healthy/vegetarian/vegan food options are available - there seems to be a lot of fast/gluttonous food. To me, produce is overpriced too, but a convenient offering of fresh fruits & veggies for those living in the city.

It's frequently delicious, mildly adventurous and easy for groups big and small.  I've returned several times to both this and the Old City location.

The Good:

Delicious Sichuan food with the right amount of spice for anyone (you pick on a scale of 1-10).  The Dan Dan noodles are a personal favorite (any every one else agrees), the Bok Choi is a great add on and I have yet to dislike any entree.

The service is pretty standard.  As I like to say, if you didn't notice it was bad, then it was good.  Also, the food comes somewhere between an ideal pace and fast.  

The Old City location is a bit more enjoyable ambiance than the U City one.  Things are dim, but the decorations and furnishings are nice.  It's slightly less accommodating to large groups, but YMMV.  

I think the prices are pretty reasonable.  Entrees range from 15-20 dollars but are meant for more than one person.  It's hard to say if it's a good deal, but the food is still excellent.

The Bad:

One issue I find is that it's hard to push the issue on spiciness.  I've grown to really enjoy some heat and it's hard to get servers to really let the chef kick it up a notch.  

The other issue is that I often don't feel super great the next day after eating.  Maybe that's the spices or my amateur palate or the several cocktails I had.

The conveyor belt aspect really intrigued me.  I love being able to get a variety of ingredients, but often times with hot pot you can only order maybe up to 3-4 ingredients plus your meat option because they tend to be generous portions and you get full.  At Chubby Cattle, not only do they have wagyu beef options which is unique, but the conveyor belt portions are so much smaller.  This might be a weird thing to say about a restaurant, but smaller portions means more room for more things.  The plates that the ingredients are rotating on are color coded to indicate their price (which is shown on the side of your table) and they're all pretty cheap.  You can rack up a TON of plates and still not run up a huge tab.
The wait staff is really friendly and super helpful - I had no idea what I was doing with ordering and the conveyor belt and they all were there to answer questions promptly and thoroughly.
I got the oxtail tomato broth and my partner got the tonkotsu miso.  I absolutely adored my broth - I think it might be my favorite non-spicy broth option, it was so incredibly savory and the tomato flavor also rounded it out nicely.
The interior is pretty spacious, and this would be a great option for taking guests who have never done hot pot too (especially again because everything is portioned smaller, if you don't like a hot pot ingredient, you can get rid of it fast!).  You do low key have to know though what is what - they are price labelled, but not labelled with what they are (though most are easy to figure out). You can also still order off the menu if you don't see anything you want coming down the belt.
I wish they had a more extensive sauce bar, like LaTao hot pot (my #1 spot) but their sauce options aren't too bad! 
Also, I would recommend just sticking to the hot pot - we decided to splurge a little and get wagyu foie gras nigiri and it was good but not amazing and probably not worth its price - learn from my mistake.",Chubby Cattle,19107,"{'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'RestaurantsReservations': 'True', 'OutdoorSeating': 'False', 'RestaurantsAttire': ""u'casual'"", 'RestaurantsTakeOut': 'True', 'HappyHour': 'False', 'NoiseLevel': ""u'average'"", 'Ambience': ""{'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'classy': True, 'casual': False}"", 'WiFi': ""u'no'"", 'RestaurantsDelivery': 'True', 'RestaurantsTableService': 'True', 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': 'True', 'HasTV': 'False', 'BusinessParking': ""{'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}"", 'Caters': 'False', 'GoodForMeal': ""{'dessert': True, 'latenight': True, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': True, 'brunch': None, 'breakfast': None}"", 'WheelchairAccessible': 'True', 'DogsAllowed': 'False', 'GoodForKids': 'True', 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '2', 'BikeParking': 'True', 'Alcohol': ""u'beer_and_wine'""}","Restaurants, Bars, Seafood, Japanese, Hot Pot, Nightlife, Chinese, Conveyor Belt Sushi, Mongolian, Asian Fusion",0.2173185941043084,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Chubby Cattle,19107,Center,0.2173185941043084,0.9954,0.2173185941043084

We had the soup with shrimp and with beef tendon. The house was definitely not skimpy with either of the proteins. Lots of shrimp and tendon in the broth. I think the tendon may have gone through a pressure cooker, there was really no bite to it. The broth could have used a little more something, but we were happy after adding some hot oil. 

They have supplies of soup spoons, chopsticks and napkins available at each table, along with hot oil, sriracha and other condiments.

While it's difficult to compete with the cheap and delicious Chinese restaurants just a couple streets down in Chinatown, Jane G's is a classy Chinese establishment in Philadelphia and offers an average dining experience at a moderate price. The interior is pretty as well, with plenty of space and tables in an ornate set-up, so definitely great for formal occasions or just the quick dinner take-out as well.

From my visits, I have found the food to be just average, notwithstanding the huge assortment of similar restaurants nearby in Chinatown. From the Dan Dan noodles to its Peking duck dishes, the food is alright, but I left wanting more in both portion sizes and taste. The Dan Dan noodles were decently tasty, but just a little bit on the salty side, and can't beat the noodles at the aptly named Dan Dan Noodles restaurant just a couple blocks away in Center City. Most of the main dishes are just lacking in taste and aroma, not packing the punch that I was looking for from a Szechuan restaurant, but I do like the Chili Oil Wontons... definitely my favorite dish and appetizer whenever I come here.

The interior is quite intricate and visually appealing, with the perfect lighting combination at dinner--not too dark nor too light, perfect for the special occasion or even a formal business meeting--and suits the crowd at the towering buildings of the financial district of Philly. Its location is a bit out of the way, about halfway between 30th Street Station and Suburban Station, unless of course you work in one of the JFK blvd buildings, in which case its location is perfect.

Atmosphere and service: the inside is very nice with a semi chic vibe. It wasn't too loud either. I can't wait until it's warm enough for them to open the doors to let the sun and breeze in!!

The prices were pretty low too! 

Food: literally so good! We had the Brussels sprouts, wasabi shrimp, pancakes and chicken and broccoli and it was all delicious! I just want to order everything because I just know it will be good. Be aware, there are spice levels that they allow you to choose from. If you can't take the heat stick to a 1!

When we arrived today, lady behind the desk (same person I spoke over the phone twice) was beyond rude. 
She said: too much food, we are taking a table for kids that other costumers could use. We were there 1pm, we were the only one in the restaurant. We left 2:15pm, there were 2 other couples in the restaurant.

Went back for lunch today and was immediately seated. Nice surprise and a bit different than the hour and a half wait last time.

Very attentive servers who kept checking back and charming were so much better than our waiter the first time as well. 

A5 wagyu sashimi with good wasabi and soy was available this time and very nice. 

The tomato oxtail broth is fantastic. As before the Yuzu and toppings on point. 

I have to say, although expensive, this is so much better than other hot pot establishments that I've had that it's worth it if you can afford it.

Usually the broth is just a cooking medium at other places. Here, after finishing my meats and vegetables I find myself drinking the broth as well because it's so good. Even before departing, one last sip of the broth...yum...So nice how all of the meats and vegetables permeate the broth after cooking and topped off with that delicious sauce I could just drink the stuff all day.

Atmosphere: Venue is beautiful, but people kind off dress however they see best. Business casual is fine, but jeans and a t-shirt is also more than fine. Go with small parties or big, they will accommodate you. Make a reservation for dinner, especially if your party is on the larger side. 

Food:  Delicious as always. For 6 people we ordered, scallion pancakes, 2 orders of Dan Dan noodles, cumin-style tofu, and garlic sauce - style tofu. We also ordered a side of the dan-dan noodle sauce on the side with chili oil on the side. Everything was delicious and comes out made to order (when it's ready, they send it out). 

Drinks: I've had the Empress drink before, and it was really good! Otherwise I just get water with lemon.

Service: Great service, quick, efficient, WELL PRICED!

Pro tip: portions are huge, so maybe start with fewer things and order more as you need.

Pro tip #2: adjust spice levels to what you want! You can also just ask for the chili oil and do it yourself as needed.

Steamed Crab Meat Pork Soup Dumplings - can't decide between having bits of pork or king crab ooze out of your supple & warm soup dumplings? Go with both for maximum flavor!

Crystal Shrimp Dumplings - the perfect combo of tender cooked shrimp and just a little bit of a spicy cook.

HK Style Shumai - Amazing bits of sausage wrapped in dumpling skin. What's not to like?

Scallion Pancake - a simple dim sum classic done right!

Roast Pork Buns - bao style buns with perfectly cooked pork sandwiched inside.

They give you complementary snacks while waiting for food to arrive if dining in (pickled vegetables and Chinese style salted peanuts). 

The food came out pretty fast and also freshly made, which is very surprising.

Dishes to try:
-Chong Qing spicy chicken ( a bit pricey than usual but with it). Side note: pretty large portion dining in but take out they seem to give a little less :(
-scallion pancakes
-cumin lamb or beef
-best hot and sour soup in philly Chinatown
-Dry hotpot

It's a roaming food truck that doesn't have a specific location, but participates in a lot of weekly food truck events in and outside the city. This month, you can find them in LOVE Park every Wednesday during the Lunch in LOVE program.

Now I'm no expert on dumplings or spring rolls, but I've never had a bad experience with either. They have a lot of different options on their menu to choose from, all of which include a description to let you know what you're getting. I wasn't sure what to get at first but when I saw their Sample Platter, which includes serving options for one or two people, I figured this would be a good place to start. At $14.00, it might seem a little pricey to some, but the amount of food you're served more than makes up for it. I placed my order and was served after about five minutes or so.

When sat down to eat and opened the box, I couldn't believe how much food there was! I mean I knew it was a sampler, but I never expected this much! I got six dumplings in total: three of the Infamous ""Piggy"" and three of the Veggies in Heaven. The Infamous ""Piggy"" contains pork and chives (hence the name), and the Veggies in Heaven is a combination of seasonal veggies, glass noodles, and exotic mushrooms. In addition to the dumplings, I got the original spring roll and a side of truffle fries. The dumplings were perfect. Soft enough that they melt in your mouth, but just crispy enough on the outside. The truffle fries were some of the best I've ever had, and appear to be a favorite among guests. You're also given access to as much soy sauce as you want, which is a great addition to the dumplings and spring rolls.

Dump-N-Roll has a few other dumplings and spring rolls on their menu in addition to the ones I got with my order. There's the Chick-A-Palooza, which consists of chicken, veggies, and spices, and a specialty dumpling called the Holy Phuc Wonton. The description for the Holy Phuc Wonton reads ""award-winning tempura turkey bacon cheese burger wonton"". I haven't tried it yet, but that sounds awesome right off the bat. They also have a spring roll called the Ooey-Gooey Mac, which is a spring roll stuffed with mac and cheese.

Like I said earlier, Dump-N-Roll can be found in LOVE Park every Wednesday of this month from 11:00am to 3:00pm. Next Month, they'll be spending their Wednesdays at the Porch at 30th Street Station. They participate in a lot of other food truck events in the area and even offer catering services for private events.

Good food, nice clean interior, and some unique dishes that I haven't seen at other chinese restaurants in the city. 

Menu is HUGE and a bit daunting with all of the rather unique ingredients (Intestines, fungus, feet, pig ears, etc etc). Nice pictures with everything that was relatively accurate to what we got. As others have said the smashed eggplant with preserved egg was excellent and very different. Also had the griddle cooked short ribs which were nice and spicy and cooked very well. We also got some on the hose edamame, pickled veggies, and green tea ice cream which was a nice touch. Service was good and one of the waiters very nicely explained to us how to mash the eggplant and egg ourselves to our desired flavor. 

Honestly, menu was almost TOO big and a bit confusing as to how it was organized which can make it hard for people not familiar with the cuisine to order. Had the cold chili chicken too which was very meh. 2/3 ain't bad though right?

Penang didn't disappoint, and was, in fact, quite true to the style of Malaysian food we had on the trip. 

The chicken satay is absolutely perfect. Made is fatty chicken thighs, the skewers bore the signature sweetness from the dry rub that one expects from a good satay. The dipping sauce was just the right consistency and had the right amount of heat too. Highly recommend. 

For our main courses, we had the Chow Kueh Teow and the Nasi Lemak. The chow kueh teow tasted just like the version we had at the hawker stalls in Singapore, and I enjoyed the beef that was included in the nasi lemak. I'm looking forward to coming back to try more of the food. 

Another bright spot of the meal is that the food is very inexpensive. For the three dishes I mentioned, our tab was less than $30. Great value for the price. 

If I have minor critique it's that the service was a bit slow and a bit brusque. I don't mind, since I didn't have anywhere to be and I just wanted food (could take of leave the smile). But just something to consider if you are in a rush or only want to interact with someone with a perma-grin.

As for our entrees, the lo mein was passable, and the Lobster missed the mark for me.

For a 40$ value, it is a nice amount of lobster, but the sauce was very overwhelming.

Everything about the place is lovely but I would not recommend it for a big group. Firstly, they would not sit us until our entire group was there, which is understandable but also somewhat annoying when we had a reservation and we had to wait for 9 people to all arrive before we could be seated (2 of them ended up stuck in really bad Broad Street traffic). I really recommend making a reservation as it will get busy very quickly on popular days (Thurs-Sat). 

The interior is your typical modern asian-fusion style place with low lighting and loud environment from the mixture of almost clubby music and tables packed together. The decorations were very modern and interesting but nothing really wow-ing, which is understandable since we are there for the food, not the decorations. Waiters seem to be good at their jobs and pretty attentive while the hostesses seem very dismissive and anxious about how they are going to seat all the reservations they accepted. 

I had the Sampan version of the moscow mule and it was very good along with most of the other drinks I tried from friends. As for the food, we ended up doing the chefs selection which is $45 a head and it was all delicious. We got to chose about 8 different dishes and they brought them very quickly, almost too quickly as we barely had time to breath in-between bites. All of the selections we made were wonderful and I don't think they brought us out any food that we didn't scarf down. That being said, the bill was very expensive and we were not sure how if we didnt do the chefs selection and ordering just a few tapas would go for filling up 9 people. Everything we got from our selection included: Chicken Bao Bun (pretty good, kinda tasted like Chik-fil-a), Pork Potsticker (a crunchy and light potsticker), Korean BBQ Beef (one of the best in our opinion, very tender and flavorful), Crispy Rock Shrimp (pretty much your average battered rock shrimp), Szechuan Chicken Stir-fry (wish we could have ordered two of these because it was so delicious, we ate it all in about 2 minutes), Seafood Stir Fry (pretty good but wish it included more seafood, it was mainly scallops and shrimp), Kim Chee Fried Rice (your better-than-average fried rice), and finally the Shrimp Pad Thai (pretty average but its hard to deviate from a standard pad thai). 

All-in-all the food was delicious and the environment was cool and I would love to go back with one or two friends but would not come back with a large group as the price climbs quickly (even if you don't do the chefs selection) and the space is somewhat cramped and loud to really talk to everyone from your group.",Sampan,19107,"{'GoodForKids': 'False', 'RestaurantsAttire': ""u'casual'"", 'OutdoorSeating': 'True', 'RestaurantsReservations': 'True', 'NoiseLevel': ""u'average'"", 'Alcohol': ""u'full_bar'"", 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': 'True', 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '2', 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'BusinessParking': ""{'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}"", 'HasTV': 'False', 'Caters': 'True', 'BikeParking': 'False', 'ByAppointmentOnly': 'True', 'RestaurantsTableService': 'True', 'Ambience': ""{'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': True, 'upscale': False, 'classy': True, 'casual': False}"", 'WiFi': ""u'no'"", 'DogsAllowed': 'False', 'BusinessAcceptsBitcoin': 'False', 'HappyHour': 'True', 'WheelchairAccessible': 'True', 'GoodForMeal': ""{'dessert': False, 'latenight': None, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': True, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}"", 'RestaurantsDelivery': 'False', 'RestaurantsTakeOut': 'False'}","Thai, American (New), Restaurants, Chinese, Asian Fusion, Tapas/Small Plates, Pan Asian",0.1858004712301587,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,Sampan,19107,Center,0.1858004712301587,0.9967,0.1858004712301587

There is also a separate menu for beverages.  Many in our party did not understand the beverage menu.  Apparently if you are drinking alcoholic beverages, you have 3 pricing options and it is all you can drink, I think.  However, it also states non-alcoholic beverages, so we assumed it was $30 for all you can drink iced-tea.  What was probably the most disappointing was that people drinking alcohol didn't know they had to ask for refills and didn't know that it was all you can drink, so many in our group ended up paying $30 for one beer.  And then if you are just drinking iced tea and coffee, there is no fee at all.  Before you go, you probably want to vet this out a little more and make sure all in your party understand how the beverages work.

We had menu #1.  I couldn't tell you what we ate because it all came out in waves and we didn't have a menu in front of us, we only had the confusing beverage menu.  Again, people in our party were confused about courses, so some people were eating a lot at first not realizing there was more food coming.  It didn't appear we received enough of each dish for 11 people.  We had steamed dumplings and we didn't know there were two trays stacked (it's so dark in there), so they got cold before we realized there were more in there.

Everything I had was very good.  Everything was warm enough (could have been warmer), everything was well seasoned and very flavorful.

Dessert seemed skimpy.  The hit were the home made donuts but, again, not enough for everyone at the table.  I'm not sure if we were allowed to ask for more.

Service was excellent, our table was ready when we arrived, but we could not sit down until our entire party arrived as we were all coming from different hotels.  We paid a $400 deposit, so I think it was clear we were good for the table and should have been allowed to be seated.

Bathrooms were clean and enough to accommodate the crowded place.

We had heard countless students in University City hype this place up and tell us how great the Dan Dan Noodles and other menu items were.

We had made a reservation ahead of time, and we came in at the time of it and were seated promptly. Once we had placed our orders of 'Chicken Dumplings' and 'Dan Dan Noodles,' we waited to receive our food. Upon trying the 'Dan Dan Noodles ,' me and my 2 other friends were grossed out by the flavor. With a description of having peanut sauce, this seemed like something we were interested in. However, the noodles tasted more like straight peanut oil, and they left a very sticky residue on the tongue. 

Although it was kind of awkward, we were able to have our waited take them back, and take our new orders for us. Upon waiting for our new orders of 'Garlic Sauce Style' chicken, we were served our dumplings, which were mediocre at best. They tasted kind of like packaged ones that I buy at the grocery store.

A manager of some sort came up to us to ask about what we didn't like about the 'Dan Dan Noodles,' which I appreciated but also felt bad about.

Once our main dishes of 'Garlic Sauce Style' chicken came out, they were SO salty. I just felt like I was eating thin strips of chicken with so much salt and garlic. 

Although I came in with high expectations, I'm so sad to say that none of the food even lived up to average quality. I do feel bad saying this, because I know many fans of the restaurant. The customer service was also decent.

The restaurant has a fun, modern aura with the Japanese style conveyer belt running through the middle, brick/wood panel walls, and small booths with individual hot-pot stoves for each person. 

I got the House Hellish Spicy Broth at the Entry Spicy level, enough spice to get your attention but not too hot that you don't enjoy the meal (for those with a low spice tolerance beware, even at the lowest level it has a kick).

As a table we split the Beef combo (comes with wagyu brisket, angus prime rib eye, and Australian Short Rib) which is a great value and very good mix, along with Udon Noodle (nothing special), Glass Noodles (they were great but suggest holding it while you cook or you'll lose them in the pot), Sweet Corn (highly recommend, we ended up getting another order), and baby bok choi (solid).

Place: kind of hard to find, not too much room to sit

Good lord, I didn't think I ordered beef jerky. It was hard to bit into and had zero flavor. The only flavor is cumin covering the taste of burnt crap. It tasted how my cat turds smells. I was disgusted and couldn't finish it. Chicken was the most tolerable one and tasted something resembling chicken and not cat turd or over burnt/unrecognizable meat. Squid had all the spices concentrated in a pocket and tasted like...well squid. Tofu puff just tasted one frozen puffs thawed out with cumin.

I will never go anywhere near this horrible place again. I dined in with two of my close friends while we were exploring the city. We arrived with more than 30 minutes before their closing time and a general idea of what we were planning to order so we could speed the dining process up allowing them to close sooner. We did not order appetizers and did not even ask for any changes to our entrees, which again only sped up the dining process.

Immediately after walking in, we were not made to feel welcomed at all and the staff made all three us feel extremely awkward about being there. They gave us a very ""uneasy"" feeling because we were hoping to dine in with what they thought was close to closing. I recall having to repeat that we wanted to eat in more than once. After ordering our food, the food was absolutely MEDIOCRE AT BEST... Rather bland and boring. The noodles I got in my stir fry felt much closer to a pasta than a more traditional Asian noodle. Absolutely overpriced on top of the mediocre quality. However the worst hasn't even happened... Someone came over to our, presumably the restaurant manager and asked us to please pay for the food. I said sure and continued eating assuming she meant ""pay when you are finished"". NOT EVEN A MINUTE LATER she came back and said ""can you please pay now?""... All three of us were in the middle of eating but I figured it's not a huge deal, and my one friend and I handed her our debit cards to pay for the meal... ""Cash only"". She said there is an ATM right outside the door. So I said sure and continued eating figuring there was absolutely no way she wanted us to stand up and get money at that very moment. I was VERY wrong. Now for a third time she asked for us to pay... NOW. We stood up and walked to the ATM that was turned off. It appeared to be an older unit and needed to boot up. You better believe this thing took it's time to turn on... At least 5 minutes and the staff made us stand there for the entire 5 minutes. Finally, the restaurant manager came over and told us we could pay in card... Meaning!: THIS ENTIRE GOD DAMN TIME THEY COULD HAVE TAKEN OUR DEBIT CARDS FROM THE START! In the midst of all this, the waitress took our unfinished meals. Now to top the whole ""wonderful"" experience off, I was handed my receipt to sign. I didn't even CONSIDER for ONE GOD DAMN SECOND to tip the staff after such an awful experience. I signed the receipt and handed it back to the lady and the other 2-3 staff around her watching. They looked at it confused and handed it back to me. I couldn't BELIEVE this was actually happening, so I kindly wrote the exact total in the ""total"" section of the receipt, left the tip section blank, and handed it back. These people actually had the audacity to GIVE ME DIRTY LOOKS!

I would no sooner wish even my worst enemy to eat at a such a disgraceful restaurant and I wouldn't eat there if it was the last god damn place on Earth!

When our ACP day meeting was over , I decided to take a stroll through Chinatown. My aim was to explore this part of the city. There were so many restaurants on both sides of the the 10th Street. Being a relatively new one, I just wanted to try this restaurant. It was relatively empty. I was greeted cordially and seated without a delay. The waitress Simin ( if I remember her name correctly) was very friendly and helpful. She went over the menu and explained the process of using hot pots with different ingredients. There were 4 places on the table to setup hot pots. You choose the broth first. Then you choose different ingredients to cook in the broth. The cooking time is different with different ingredients. You create your own dipping sauce based on your taste. I had trouble taking the long noodles out of the cooking pot. Of course, Simin helped me to get those out from the pot and transferred to the bowl. I tried scallops, fish balls, beef and noodles. It was really fun to cook and I enjoyed the meal. 
If you like to have fun while making your meal, this is the right place for you.
The price is $$$ , but worth the fun.

CASH ONLY

Must get: eggy waffles, takoyaki (takes 15 min)
Meh: curry fish balls, pork/veggie buns (beware of the rice paper)
Missed: noodles

When you arrive, it's clear that this little store has something for everything, and it's all within $2-4. My favorite of course, is the eggy-waffles that is made right in front of you with the store's secret batter. The magic of the waffle is not just the fact it's made fresh, but it forces you to take the time and wait patiently as the batter sizzles and forms into hot little balls of magic that's sweet on the tongue, but not overwhelming. It's an amazing snack to devour solo or share with friends. The first time I had it, it was perfection, the second time felt a little less cooked.

Yummy Yummy's next best item is the takoyaki, and I highly recommend eating it while it's still piping hot and inhaling as you eat. I like how the bonito flakes dance around and I was glad that the balls weren't too oversaturated with the mayo-sauce.

Unfortunately, I was not a big fan of the pork buns, despite it's $0.90 price, as there was just not enough filling. The curry fish balls were good and juicy, but a little on the pricier side for just 4.

Everything was really good, and I especially loved the tofu skin rolls--it was the first time that I've had anything resembling a spring roll since getting celiac, and wow, I've missed them. The fried shrimp and bacon rolls were good but more of an American appetizer than dim sum, and something I'd skip next time around. Prices are a bit high so things can get expensive quickly--I'd recommend starting small and then ordering more in increments if you decide you're still hungry. In terms of space, the restaurant is super cute, but gets incredibly crowded as the night goes on... definitely make a reservation. Last Friday, they only had one waitress working the entire first floor, i.e. taking orders, hostessing, running drinks, and bartending.

There is free parking in the back which is so clutch. Also, the service is fantastic and they are very prompt with your orders. There is plenty of seating, so no problems their either. 

I also had some cheese foam tea which was delicious- they use either like chrysanthemum or rose or some essence of a flower which adds a delightful flavor accent. It was a bit sweet though, so I recommend getting maybe 50 or 30 percent sugar.

Our wait for a table of 3 took about 40 minutes, hence, I would definitely recommend reserving a table ahead of time. The restaurant is split off into two sections, tables that have each personal grills and then tables that have a center stove for family-style hot pot. We were more interested in the grills, but the wait was too long so we took what was available to give it a shot even though it was the ""more expensive option."" Our server was nice, but lacked attention to our table compared to the one next to us. He explained everything thoroughly, and considering it was all new to my friends and I, we got a basic general understanding of what was what. We proceeded to order the Spicy Soup and the Oxtail Soup for our Hotpot and added various amenities from the menu including Meatballs, Octopus, and one of the beef. A problem we had was that we ordered an order of dumplings as an appetizer, but they didn't have it in stock at the time. I'm not sure if there was a misunderstanding between the server and me, but we got an order of this well designed beef that came with a good presentation with vapor. What we got was apparently ""Beef Tongue."" We thought it was the dumplings that we ordered, didn't realize until we got the receipt, and ate it anyways. To our surprise, tasted pretty good, but was shocked to the price of it that it was $20 for 3 Rose shaped slices of beef tongue. Our server was able to get us 30% off for the misunderstanding which was good b/c the dumplings we wanted was probably around $12.

We ordered 4 to share (we always do #familystyle): the house special noodle soup w/hand-pulled noodles, braised sliced beef noodle soup with shaved noodles, stir-fried seafood hand-pulled noodles, and peanut sauce dry noodles. (The waiters helpfully brought smaller bowls for us so that we could eat from all the dishes.) 

The noodle soups both tasted great; the braised beef soup contained shaved noodles that had a good texture, though I felt like they could have been a bit more generous with the portion of meat. In contrast, the amount of seafood in the stir-fry noodle dish - which was savory with the perfect touch of sweet - was pretty big. The peanut sauce dry noodle is only a little over $4, but it tasted great as well and the portion size was surprisingly large.

The food is pretty decent, except for Sang Kee which has incredible duck dishes and char siu as well. Most things are a little bit overpriced, but I guess you are paying for the experience.

Beiler's has good donuts, but lines are long. 
Bassetts has good ice cream with lots of creamy flavors. 
Dutch eating place for apple dumplings. 
DiNics for a pork sandwich (personally not a fan but others like it). 
Kamal's Middle Eastern for a mint lemonade or some other fun and unique drink. 
Sang Kee for a duck fried rice. 
Mueller for a fresh soft pretzel. 

Other people have things they like also, but these are the ones I commonly hear about- I've tried them all and they're all solid.

I was out yesterday and someone was speaking about this place that had a great happy hour but couldn't remember the name. After learning that she liked happy hour i suggested sampan and to my surprise she was speaking of sampan already. It's the talk of the town!! You can drink and eat at happy hour for less than 30 bucks before you are full and boozy. The sushi ice cream roll is also a must have. I'm just saying if your still sitting here and reading this review your wasting time. Start getting ready how happy hour starts at four and it's a pretty popular place so early arrival is highly suggested. One of the good things is the food comes fast so the wait is never too long but even if it is it's always worth the wait. And I'll let u in in a secret if you get there and it's too crowded Ed try next door and double knot they share the same exact happy hour. I would talk about the decor but i thought you wanted to know about the food lol. It's nice inside and outside at the graffiti bar which is also apart of this place. Where you can enjoy happy hour or not outside and don't have to worry about the street traffic.

The restaurant is super trendy with cool mood lighting, and felt like it could have turned into a club at any point. We went all out and did the 7-course tasting menu, where you get to pick 1-2 items from each category (somehow, we were all able to come to a consensus as a table on what items to get). This was very reasonably priced at $45/person and a good way to try a lot of dishes. Note: if you have any vegetarians in the group, they can do a vegetarian tasting menu for that person or let them opt out and just order a la carte, which I thought was very accommodating. 

Now for the dishes! Here's what we enjoyed from most to least:
- Amazing: waygu beef (absolutely melts in your mouth), crispy rock shrimp (super crispy with just the right amount of sauce), XO scallops (seared perfectly), crispy brussel sprouts (couldn't stop eating) 
- Great: peking duck (with yummy scallion buns, but you have to eat it quickly or else the duck gets a bit tough), seafood dumpling (nice chili sauce), edamame dumpling (very unique and can definitely taste the truffle, but paled in comparison to the ones I had at Buddakan the night before)
- Average: shrimp pad thai (a little too much sauce, nothing mindblowing), roasted broccoli (a bit plain)

They finish off the meal with 2 types of soft serve ice cream cones, which were orange creamiscle and chocolate cherry our night (I think it rotates). Definitely recommend the tasting menu for your first time here as it was a really fun group experience (dishes just keep coming out) and you get to try a lot.

+ hamachi ceviche (not that high on my list of ceviches. It was a bit watery and did not have too much fish) 

+ general Tsos soup dumplings (the flavor is great, but the dumpling wrapper is very very delicate, so many of us had our dumpling burst in the process of picking it up)

+ wagyu beef skewer (my favorite dish of the night! Beef is tender and the slightly sweet jam-like sauce gives a nice acidity)

+ beef short rib lettuce cup (you diy your cups. This was good, not amazing. Beef is mashed to almost a paste-like consistency)

I had a hard time picking from the menu so I just kind of randomly picked a bunch of things That sounded good and then ordered. It was like Christmas when I got it and I was not disappointed.

Drunk review: it's still freaking delicious! Even cold, that lo mein is amazing. Sure, it's nothing spectacular, but many hours later it's not spoiled like so many places!

You can get better food elsewhere for less.

Avocado tempura app  - Too mushy and had no flavor. Could not eat it.  I love avocado I salads and sushi, but fried it tastes completely different.

Grilled scallops app - 3 scallops, all overcooked, and two of them had a little sand in them.  Disgusting.

Shrimp tempura dinner - 4 small pieces of shrimp and 4 pieces of sweet potato.  The tempura was not crunchy and it was soggy.  The portion was small and not worth it.

Filet mignon teriyaki dinner - I asked for medium and my steak was burnt on the outside and overcooked in the middle. (see photo).  I can't believe I paid $22 for this and can barely eat it.  Small portion as well.

Smoked salmon sushi - fresh 

California roll - tasted good to me and fresh. Who can screw that up?

Having the original Nom Wah in Chinatown nyc and eating dim sum all my life and in Philly, the dim sum I had was as dreary as the lighting in the place. Never been to a Dim sum where it was dark, usually expect bright lights lots of people running around yelling and fresh hot food. I got slow service, byob wine bottles everywhere, oily and lackluster food that was brought out at 4 different times. Really? I don't want to eat my meat last. They brought out in order of 15 minutes for the scallion pancakes, another 10 for the OG, another 10 for the shrimp shu Mai and chicken fest, and another 10 for pork ribs. What the heck? If you folks have eaten Dim sum you pair and eat things together not just eat a whole tray of meat by itself. 

Also regarding the food, it was totally not made fresh to order that's a complete lie. My chicken feet, the feet was cold and skin soggy. That usually means it was made and reheat again probably like a day or more ago. I would like to see how you get cold chicken feet, never had that at a dim sum before. Maybe nobody orders chicken feet here?
Also, the scallion pancakes were soo oily, how do you make it so bad? It's not hard just get fresh dough, scallions, roll it up and press down then pan fry on both sides until brown and crispy. This was like thrown into the frier for like 10 mins until the oil seeps in. Same concept with chicken wings to not have oily skin. 

The shumai the skin was falling off couldn't pick it up, means it was old. The only saving grace was the tea and the OG. The OG was crispy and egg roll omelette and veggies pretty good combo. I feel like everything would've been good and my review much better if it was cooked well, on time, service better and priced better but unfortunately for me not coming back a byob dim sum isn't my thing.

This is it.  if you are in the mood for hotpot you can not go wrong with this place.  I came by myself and ordered the fatty brisket and shrimp with bokchoy and oyster mushrooms and udon noodles.  I also ordered the grilled scallops as an appetizer but more on that later.  My total bill was about $50 and I had so much left overs, this is definitely a place that  someone can eat for $20-30/person easily.  In addition you can get your own soup base for just a few bucks so you can easily have the same number of protein as I did but have another type of broth for a few bucks more.

The broth I chose was the tomato based one and it was very good, a little hint of sour like lemon grass and a little bit of spice, perfect to compliment the beef and shrimp.  When you are served your dinner you are also given a variety of condiments and sauces you can customize your broth further.  I definitely would suggest also the oyster mushrooms as it soaks up the soup and gives you that texture that brings the broth in even closer contact with your taste buds.

They won't let your table order hot pot unless everyone orders a hot pot, by the way.

A steal maybe! But not exactly wallet friendly. 

The hot pot was more reasonably priced ... but if you're an impatient eater like me, expect to get your mouth scorched - you need to blow on the soup or figure out how to lower the temperature with the buttons under the table. There is a hot pot for each seat and they are close enough to the edges that you can eat right out of them - although I would not recommend that. The cups they give you are very tiny too- would be smart to ask for a bowl so you don't have to constantly fill up - and so it can cool a little more over time. 
I went with the mushroom broth - it was just okay.

This was my first stop in Philadelphia, fresh off the plane and having just had the chance to drop off luggage at my friend's house. All we knew was that we were hungry and also wanted to take in some sights. So we walked down the street and headed straight for the market. And this place was PACKED! I was not prepared for the onslaught of sights and sounds and choices. I had researched some things to try - such as the pretzels, donuts, and pork sandwich - but that barely scratched the surface of what this market has to offer. I mean, c'mon, chocolate noses! 

The first day, we tried the pork sandwich with broccoli rabe and sweet pepper and it was quite tasty. Also loved the pretzel. The donuts were unique although not my favorite, but there are definitely so many to choose from you are bound to find something you enjoy - we tried the key lime, oreo creme, and sugar. 

The next day we needed a quick breakfast and had to stop by for famous scrapple and the hot apple dumpling. When it came down to a choice of adding heavy or whipped cream, I decided to be daring and go with some heavy cream and I have never been happier with my decision! That hot apple dumpling was one of my favorite things. And scrapple was unique. I ended up adding some syrup and enjoyed it. Definitely not something I get back home!

I agree with others: not oily, tasted fresh. Will order again. Well, some things. 

Shrimp egg foo young & mu shu pork were outstanding. 

The family liked the shrimp egg rolls & dumplings. I gave up my eggroll because they loved it so much so I didn't get to try. I did try one dumpling, I personally didn't care for it. 

We had pork fried rice... It was fine. The Singapore noodles were lacking. But my wife put it in the pan and added seasonings, and then it was amazing. So we honestly don't mind getting Singapore noodles again just to throw it in the pan and fix it up a little. It's like they gave us a great head start, LOL.

The only downfall was the orange chicken. I've got that with the kids in mind. They use the rind or the zest of the orange. It is so bitter and terrible. I appreciate the fresh zest, but that was a fail. And we literally are dreading having to eat this chicken, but I'm not wasting it because it was around $9. We're eating this bitter chicken!

I remember it being way to spicy for my taste at the time, but since then my spice tolerance has grown so much thanks to all the cool foodies I know who forced me to embrace the spice lol

I took the family here for Mother's Day because I knew everyone in that area of University city would be out of town, so the restaurant wouldn't be overly crowded or marking up the price that day.

We were told all the food is served family style so 3-4 dishes should feed 7-8 ppl which was pretty accurate. The host said rice comes out unlimited, but the only tedious thing was having to constantly ask for it instead of them bringing it out as we finished or just bring out one super huge bowl. We are professional rice eaters in my family, and I don't think Han Dynasty was prepared for that. 

We ordered the Scallion pancakes,Dan Dan Noodle,  Pepper Chicken , on Black Bean Style Fish, and one Garlic Tofu dish. All were solid, but the  Black Bean style fish was by far the best. The flavor was so sweet and spicy all at once and the fish was super moist. The cold Dan Dan noodles packed ALOT of spice and flavor as well. I wish I could take that sauce on the noodles home and pour it on everything...except cereal of course.

I ordered the tofu and broccoli entree with rice, a vegetable spring roll, and an order of Chinese donuts.  Most places don't have broccoli AND tofu, you get one or the other, so that was already a plus.  The tofu was crispy on the outside and the broccoli was cooked but still somewhat crunchy.  The sauce reminded me of the Chinese food I used to get back in New York...but was somehow better.  

The spring roll was not greasy and the veggies inside weren't the same chewy stringy things I usually get.  The donuts were pretty incredible, especially because you get TEN of them for $3.49.  They weren't overly sweet or greasy - just a perfect end to a great meal.

FOOD: The way this place works is you choose either stir fry or a soup base. It's cool because you can choose exactly what you want to go in each and then your level of spice. It's entirely up to you what you want your meal to be and it is priced accordingly. One warning: even mild spicy is really spicy. 

SERVICE: I can't speak highly of the service. I felt like there were a lot of waiters, but we were still lacking in service. When it was time to get the check, we had to ask 2 different people to get our check. Not a dealbreaker, but it was a little annoying.

AMBIANCE: Honestly, it's very open a pretty cool place for large groups of people. It's still overall quiet and it's very clean on the inside.

The place itself is pretty cute and got good ambience. There is a bar area to sit at, few tables on the first floor, and more tables on the second. It is a relatively small space so around peak hours on weekends a reservation might be needed. 

The food was delicious! Between me and a friend, we ordered the Dan dan noodles, Szechuan fried rice, and cumin dish with white rice. I got cumin pork but it comes in chicken, beef, and lamb as well. The dan dan noodles tasted great although they were a little mushy, but they were spicy and it's hard for me to find a place that puts enough spice into their food. I wasn't too big a fan of the fried rice, didn't seem like anything special. The cumin dish was really yummy and spicy as well! Pork was cooked perfectly. Portion sizes were decent, this was more than enough for two people and a second meal to boot. Did not try their drinks but they have an extensive drink menu and a bar (as well as happy hour) so they may be good? 

Service was quick and the servers were very attentive and helpful. Water glasses were always full and food came in a timely fashion.

We were able to set up a family style meal for eight with a set price before we went with drinks a la carte.

The food was amazing. I loved everything that came out. We had brocollini and beets for our first courses. It was then on to pasta and pizza which was top notch. Next was steak and fish which weren't my favorite but were well cooked but a bit under seasoned. Lastly was dessert my favorite of which was the panna cotta like cheesecake.

My concern and why I chose to write a yelp review was that the server did something very sketchy and something I haven't seen before as a former waitress myself or in other restaurants. At the beginning of the meal I ordered a wine and where my red flag went up is when I had 1/4 of a glass left and he refilled 1. Without asking if I'd like more and 2. It wasn't a fresh full glass of wine so I only got a 3/4 pour. This was very strange to me but I thought maybe the other girls had gotten a bottle and he forgot which wine I got.

At the end of the night it turns out he was doing this to every lady at the table who had gotten wine. Our bill came back with 9 wines between two ladies which was very high. We complained to the server with him being rude about it. The manager ended up taking a wine or two off so while appreciated I just want the server to be trained as well. It was a very sketchy practice and while I don't personally blame the restaurant I would most likely not go back knowing this server was doing this.

It's located in the outskirts of Chinatown (away from the crowds). This place seems like a more traditional dim sum joint (carts and all!). As such, I'm not sure if this place has soup dumplings (if that is what you are looking for). It's a relatively big place and didn't feel crowded, which was nice for conversations! 

The food was as expected for your average dim sum place and the price didn't seem bad (probably spent less than $12 per person). My faves were probably the pan fried chive dumplings and the fried taro balls. The dumplings were crispy on the outside with a pretty generous amount of filling. Although it was quite oil-y. The fried taro had an soft, savory taro filling with a crunchy outer shell. I was probably most disappointed with the baked pork buns (which I had high expectations for). While I liked the taste of the sweet bun in contrast with the pork, the bun, itself, was dry. When you bite into it, it was hollow with a tiny portion of bbq pork. There are bakeries in Chinatown that sell baked pork buns that were more satisfying than this one.

Overall, I felt that this place is worth trying. I would probably give Ocean City 3.5 stars. Dim sum on a weekend is such a nostalgic memory. Being able to see the carts rolling by was truly a treat that I feel many places have retired. I, personally, would take friends and family here if they wanted the traditional dim sum experience. There are many ""dim sum"" places in Chinatown, but I don't think they all serve the traditional dim sum dishes. I think this place ticks that checkbox. The service was good. I felt that the carts made their way around the restaurant quite frequently.

It's a great restaurant, although it might not fit everyone's palate given the food might be a little too spicy for many people's tastes, myself included. 

I'd recommend getting the pick your own ingredient Ma La Soup, which is basically akin to getting hot pot although it's already made for you and given to you in a separate bowl.

Pros:
* It's super super super economical, meaning value for money and purchasing power are super high.
* The serving portions are simply freakishly humongous. I've never had bigger serving portions at literally any damn restaurant in my life.
* There's a great assortment of things that you can get in your bowl, be it meat, veggies, noodles, what not.

Cons:
* It could be super spicy. It's a Sichuanese restaurant, meaning their scale of spiciness is completely different from what a normal person would expect.

You can tell that it is fresh and they make the dumplings there because they do not taste like your typical around the corner ingredients. Next up we did the fried dumplings and again, WOW! They were soooo good we ordered a second round. For dinner we had the Truffle beef fried rice and when I tell you I dream about this rice and my mouth waters, I am not joking. I can honestly say that this is the best fried rice I have ever had. We have also tried a few of the sides, but we just kept going back to the rice. The first time there was after the auto show and my fiancé ordered the sweet and sour chicken which was also really good. You could tell they batter the chicken there and it is not frozen which is really important. The prices are NOT that bad, I am not sure what other reviewers are talking about. Other places in china town have cheaper menus because you can taste that they use frozen food. Bai Wei does not and it shows! We were so happy and delighted with everything we ordered I can not wait to go back again soon! You HAVE to go! And don't forget about their desserts. I can promise you wont have room left, but make sure you get one to go! And if you're as hooked to the candies you get after your meal like I was, they are guava and you can get an entire bag of them across the street for less than $2!

The shrimp fried rice w/Broccoli and egg added had a good flavor too 

I did notice my wings had a yellowish hue to them (seems to be a trend in the northeast I don't know why nor do I find it appealing)  

The egg foo young gravy was rather thin (however that actually made it being poured over the rice better because the rice soaked it up quickly ) 

I did order 5 wings I got 4 (I think she misheard me 5 &(fried ) sounds similar enough 
All my request where met and the lady at the front seemed eager to make sure I was satisfied. 

If I had one complaint I'd say it was kinda pricey I paid about 15$ and some change. 

The homemade pink lemonade was 2$ 
The wings and shrimp fried rice platter where about 7$ 
I'm guessing the egg and broccoli plus tax cost 5$

Easy to miss from the outside, the restaurant is actually quite nice and very large on the inside. Stylish decor and a spacious dining area make for an enjoyable ambiance. The restaurant can probably seat a few hundred, but even then, it gets busy in the evening - so if you're coming with a big group, you should definitely make a reservation. It also gets quite loud due to all the people, so just keep that in mind, if you'd rather dine somewhere more peaceful.

The menu here is huge and honestly gave me a bit of decision paralysis. They offer Malaysian soups, rice dishes, noodle dishes, stir fries, and more. The descriptions are vague, making it difficult to know exactly what you'll get, so sometimes you just need to order something and hope for the best. In fact, I'm pretty sure the dish I received was different from what I ordered (the staff are a bit difficult to communicate with), but I didn't really know what my dish was supposed to look like in the first place, so I just went with it. As a solution, I recommend family-style sharing as a way to try multiple dishes (and also hedge your risk in case there's one item that isn't quite what you expected!). If you're looking for safe bets on the menu, I'd recommend the Nasi Lemak (delicious and lots of variety within the one dish) and the Hainanese chicken (simple but tasty).

After a hefty walk we had worked up an appetite and were parched as well. Ting Wong is BYOB so we were able to mull over their extensive menu while rewarding ourselves for taking the shoelace express with a couple cold ones. The service was perfect and we did not feel rushed in making our decisions with the food subsequently arriving quickly after placing our order. We began with the curry beef stew - tender beef in a golden curry sauce with onion petals laid over a bed of white rice. A nice spice but not overwhelming to those who do not enjoy spicy. Next were some egg rolls - solid classic Chinese restaurant style. Dumplings followed the egg rolls with same sentiment, solid but nothing to make or break the review. The wonton soup on the other hand was a different take than I was familiar with, eight shrimp dumplings in a bowl of broth with bok choy. Hearty enough for a cold evening but light enough to enjoy in the warmer months as well. The final app we ordered was the roast duck. This was a no brainer. Ting Wong has a butcher up front slicing and dicing tender, juicy duck almost as if to say ""I dare you not to order this"". While I'm not a duck connoisseur I've had it at much more expensive restaurants and it did not compare. Succulent, fatty, flavorful. The star of the night making for two appearances on the table. The soy chicken was next on the chopping block and like the duck it was ordered twice. Rich flavorful chicken with a pillow of white rice underneath. The final dish was roast pork pan fried noodles. Crispy noodles on the outside with soft sauce-soaked noodles beneath a generous portion of roast pork and broccoli in a sweet sauce. With a feast like this you'd expect a bill only Daddy Warbucks could splurge on - not the case. Ting Wong's very reasonable prices and bountiful choices make for a great go-to for anyone looking for a meal in Chinatown.",Ting Wong Restaurant,19107,"{'BikeParking': 'True', 'WiFi': ""u'no'"", 'NoiseLevel': ""u'average'"", 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': 'True', 'Caters': 'False', 'RestaurantsReservations': 'False', 'RestaurantsAttire': ""'casual'"", 'Alcohol': ""u'none'"", 'GoodForKids': 'True', 'HasTV': 'True', 'DogsAllowed': 'False', 'RestaurantsTakeOut': 'None', 'HappyHour': 'False', 'OutdoorSeating': 'None', 'RestaurantsDelivery': 'True', 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'GoodForMeal': ""{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': True, 'brunch': None, 'breakfast': None}"", 'Ambience': ""{'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': None, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'classy': False, 'casual': True}"", 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '2', 'BusinessParking': ""{'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}"", 'RestaurantsTableService': 'True'}","Noodles, Asian Fusion, Restaurants, Chinese, Seafood",0.08027131782945733,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Ting Wong Restaurant,19107,Center,0.08027131782945733,0.9843,0.08027131782945733

In the few years since I initially posted this review, Lucky Star is still one of my go-to sushi places in the area.  The fish is fresh, the food overall is always good, and I think it offers a great value.

Coming here for dinner over the weekend, my boyfriend and I were greeted with friendly service and were seated right away.  We were given waters and crispy wonton strips with two sauces for dipping: a sweet duck sauce and a spicy mustard. I like dunking the wonton strip in both dips for a spicy-sweet combo.

I ordered the Maki Combo which comes with your choice of three rolls under $6, plus miso soup and the house salad.  The miso soup was good (average miso flavor), and the salad was nice as well.  I really liked the dressing which was not overly acidic as I find some ginger dressings.  I do wish the salad had romaine rather than iceberg lettuce, but that's pretty standard.

The rolls I selected were:
-Salmon Avocado: Your basic salmon avo roll with good amounts of each.  This is a basic roll but it's one I always enjoy.
-Crunch Spicy Tuna:  This is one of my favorite spicy spicy tuna rolls of any restaurant.  I think theirs just has great flavor!
-Mango Shrimp: A little sweet for me, kind of like dessert sushi.  I probably won't get this one again, but that's just personal preference.  I will say the mango was perfectly ripe!

My boyfriend got the Orange Chicken entree with brown rice (you can also order white rice instead).  I don't usually like orange chicken as I find it too cloying or with a weirdly-textured sauce, but I really enjoyed this one!  I kept stealing bites.  The chicken was cooked nicely and had a lovely light crunch.  Happy to have tried this dish here.

Although Lucky Star is situated in a vaguely unwelcoming strip mall of sorts, don't let the appearance throw you off.  Inside is tasty food, good service, and a meal that won't break the bank.

It was a rainy Thursday night and I was traveling from Washington, DC to Philly.  After a tiring drive the popular spot was in sight, so I parked my car outside the restaurant.  A few taps of my phone directed me to the restaurant's website that said 
Hours : 10:30am - 10:30pm, 7 days a week 
The bright neon OPEN sign illuminated in front of my eager eyes, bringing me hope that I could still enjoy the different dumplings and delectable dishes.  At 10:22 pm I proceeded to walk in.  

Immediately I was stopped by a server (name tag said Ivan) cleaning the table who told me the kitchen was closed.  People were still eating at a few tables.  I explained I had been traveling far and pointed out the sign said OPEN.  Ivan responded that the kitchen had closed at 10pm.
I brought up the second point of the website's hours, but was ignored by the waiter who continued cleaning.

Then approached the dim corleone, the manager of mao pao - Sally, the daughter of the dim sum empire.  I had seen her picture on the website and was relieved she would break from her phone conversation to talk with me.  
Delivering to her my desire to dine at the Dim Sum from the duress of my drive, she responded that the kitchen closed at 10:20pm.  As I went to respond about the website hours, Sally turned away from me and went back to her phone conversation.

Now here's where it became frustrating - two different closing times, two different stories.  But even more hurtful was the lack of care from an owner who just went back to business, without any offer to apologize or invite me to return.

I'm not going to center on the service expectations for a bustling place like Dim Sum Garden.  Not expecting white table clothes or friendly conversations with the waiters.  You're in, you're out, you eat, you pay - the food is why you go.
But this interaction with Sally is an example of a powerhouse restaurant that understands the plateau they've achieved and can honestly turn people away without any regards for standards, and that's a dang shame.  The hours are the hours.  If a sign says OPEN turn it off, or lock the door, or how about just honor the hours?  If Sally had stopped to hear my story, apologize and just say come back tomorrow, I would have been way happier than just given the cold shoulder.  Indeed, a little bit of listening and building a long term relationship with any customer is a core value, no matter how big you get.

It's like that scene at the end of the movie Casino where Robert De Niro says ""Back in those days people knew your name, what you drank.  But in the end, they messed it all up.""  

Alas, I did not bite on the bao this evening.  I guess you dim sum and you lose some.

And since the waiter and Sally were so creative at offering their explanations of why they closed, I thought to contribute my creativity with a poem of my experience.  

I been done starvin' for the Dim Sum Garden
Kitchen's closed?  I beg your pardon?
The sign outside it gave no warnin'
The waiter's eyes they stayed ignorin'
Stomach growl, I wanted bao
But Sally said no way not now
I left still starvin' for the Dim Sum Garden
This whole experience was slim fun darlin


---
UPDATE : Sally from Dim Sum Garden read my concerns and was gracious enough to contact me.  She explained the kitchen serves dine in guests before 10:00pm, and takeout service continues for about 20 minutes prior to close at 10:30pm.  She clarified and invited me to return.  Just acknowledging guest concerns like this one even for a misunderstanding of hours is the way to go.  Take a Bao, Sally.

To explain how it works, you pretty much have a couple of options such as seaweed knots, crabsticks, tofu, etc on the conveyor belt, and depending on the color of the plate, you'll be charged for a certain price. I highly recommend picking out of the conveyor belt if you have less people, because that'll guarantee finishing the meal. I only went with my boyfriend so the conveyor belt idea was really good. We got a couple of plates of food and then ordered more important things such as vegetables and meat on the menu. I highly recommend getting the $25 meat combo, it's such a steal. We also got the Wagyu Uni and Foie Gras Uni sushi ($18 for 2) for both and I definitely recommend the Wagyu over the Foie Gras. 

Overall, service was really great as well. Only thing I would say there aren't a lot of options on the conveyor belt and menu in general, and when I put myself on the waitlist, the waitress gave up on me after 5 minutes even though on the app it says I was #10 in line, which is why I was far away shopping.

If you aren't familiar with Malaysian food, it might help you to look at their menu on line before you go because when you get there and get seated, you'll be reading at least 6 pages of dishes and trying to decide what's what, what's good and what's not too weird to your Western tastebuds and sensibilities. Chicken feet with Chinese mushroom casserole anyone?!

This place is always busy when I go but they're quick to get you seated and give you tea. I like to sit by the kitchen and watch one of the guys make the hand pulled noodles (fascinating af!) and see what's coming up to be served. The kitchen looks clean and it always smells good in this place. 

Once you place your order, service is fast. No one has ever been rude to me and if I have a question about the food, the servers are always helpful  and often funny. 3 of my all time favorites are the shrimp puffs, which are big fried puffs of minced shrimp and bacon that are put in batter and quickly deep fried then served with a mayo-ish dipping sauce. You don't expect the bacon and these are so devilishly good, not at all heavy or greasy, I always consider making a second order but good sense invariably prevails. I like the spring rolls but in reality, they are nothing special nor will they rock your culinary reality. They are stuffed with vegetables, on the bland side but their crispness and non-greasiness appeal. I just have a 'thing' for spring rolls. Hey, I never said I was perfect.

People ooh and ahh about the roti cani but this one is under my radar. It's a hunk of pita-ish bread (they call it a 'pancake') that gets dipped into a curried chicken and potato gravy. Big yawn to this one. I've had it here and at Rangoon and it's basically boring, carby comfort type food. So order it if you need comfort but don't fill up on it to the detriment of trying other things. 

The beef or chicken skewers are okay but again, nothing extraordinary. The dish I'd really recommend is the beef rendang with white rice. Let me say first off that I am not wild about Penang's white rice. It's a bit on the mushy side but once you start throwing food on top of it, that becomes less bothersome. Anyway, rendang. It's tender chunks of beef cooked in coconut milk and flavored with cinnamon, star anise, cloves, cardamom and lemongrass. It's cooked low and slow, the meat is meltingly tender and the gravy/curry is a powerhouse of mellow flavor. Not sweet. No vegetables in it, just the fall apart beef in that marvelous, rich curry gravy. 

I always get an order of vegetables, too. My go to is the Chinese broccoli (gai lan) with garlic. Simple, garlicy, fresh. The bitterness of the leafy parts contrasts nicely with the natural sweetness of the garlic. The gai lan stalks are quick cooked and crisp-tender. It's not drowning in sauce. It's a bright, tasty adjunct to some of the heavier curries. 

Portions are very generous, prices are reasonable for the quality and quantity and you can go from very basic fare-like the skewers-to fish head soup and pork intestines so there will be something on the menu to please and offend everyone.

My wife and I were walking past and saw from the window what looked to be a pretty lively restaurant with nice and clean decor, so we decided to go in. We got the Beijing zhajiang noodles, Shanghai bok choy, and stir-fried noodles with crab. 

Food - the flavor was pretty good so I was debating giving two stars instead of one. However it mainly tasted so good because it felt like they loaded it with a lot of MSG. I ended up deciding to not give a star because the noodles with crab were an absolute travesty. The crab is not removed from the shell and is embedded within the noodles. When you break open the shell you have to struggle to find a small piece of meat. They even for some reason thought it would be a good idea to leave a completely empty body of the crab on top of the noodles? On top of this, my wife bit into what she thought were noodles and ended up giving her tooth a nice hard surprise from a tiny crab shell. Later while I was eating the noodles I also felt a tiny crab shell piece stab me in my mouth. These are tiny pieces of crab shell that are impossible to see inside the noodles and are definitely going to break someone's tooth at some point. The Shanghai bok choy was acceptable, it was delicious in fact, but again tasted quite heavily of MSG. The Beijing zhajiang noodles were also authentic, but the quantity was very small so it felt like a poor value.

Service - the servers were not particularly friendly. They brought food to the wrong tables at least a couple times (including our noodles with crab) while we were there, as if they weren't very experienced with remembering who ordered what. The cooks didn't seem to be very fast because we had to wait about 15 minutes to get our whole meal (which is not very long but when you're in Chinatown it feels much longer than the norm here). Right when we got our food they immediately gave us the check and circled the tip calculations, I guess implying that we needed to tip at least 15%? This really didn't leave a great impression or atmosphere for eating. 

Finally, oddly this place doesn't have any real silverware and you're eating off paper plates and plastic bowls. I would love that if you're a cheap place providing quick food, but when I'm at a sit down place paying tip I'm usually expecting to eat off something better than a paper plate with a plastic fork. It's like this place didn't get everything ready before they opened up (I'm guessing they just newly opened?). I would give them the benefit of the doubt for being new but this was just a horrendous experience for me so I don't think I will be going back.

The lighting it perfect for all dates and pictures. The server was very young and very nice and well educated about the two menus that were being served. She was very helpful throughout the night and continuously checked up on the status of the dinner . They had both a Asian menu and a full seafood  menu. Their drink menu is very diverse with over 10 cocktails and over 11 imported beers. All of the food was ordered from the seafood menu by which the front of the menu had its simple yet really affordable appetizers. On the back of the menu is where it got good . On the back of the menu what is the amount of steamed seafood you can order along with all of their signature sauces. They also serve three different combos of Seafood boil's. First order was the fried calamari that was served with spicy duck sauce, which was really good and tasty. However, the fried calamari didn't really hold any competition with the salt and pepper fried shrimp  that was ordered next. The salt and pepper shrimp were full size prawns  with the heads still attached on them. They were fried to perfection yet being fried with the shell still on them. Yet, That didn't matter nor did it stop me from devouring the whole prawn ‍.

Our building then offered coupons for the restaurant, buy one/get one, and decided to return to try the full dinner experience. We arrived and the restaurant was nearly empty, which is not a good sign in our eyes at prime dinner time. We were served gummy dinner rolls and sent to the salad bar. A disappointment, not much to make a salad with, and quite a few pre-made salads that looked like that had sat out all day. When we tried the meats that came around (which were few and far between and the same came around a lot), they were very hard to chew through again or full of fat and gristle and we could not eat it. The only thing that was edible was the lamb and salmon, and the salmon was extremely dry. We were forced to pay 18% tip on our receipt, it is added onto your bill, so even if you receive terrible service, you will have to pay that. I think this is the first restaurant we have had this happen. Upon returning home, I became violently ill, and I believe I ended up with food poisoning.

Went here with a friend on a weekday evening and were seated quickly. Our server explained the menu, how to order, and pointed out her favorites and popular items. I really appreciate when servers do this, especially when dining at a unique place - I'm sometimes shy to ask questions!

We ordered a few BBQ skewers, a hot pot, soft shell crabs, and fried rice. Portion sizes were on point with what I expected for the prices (skewers range from $1.50-5... but with the $5 ones we ordered, you get 3 skewers)! Everything was really tasty and an overall great value. The soft shell crabs and pineapple fried rice are a MUST. The hot pot really stood out and was super fun to eat.

In short, excellent food and excellent service, but generally pricey given portion sizes. We have 5pm reservations for a Sat evening and arrived about 15 minutes early but was promptly seated regardless. The menu is printed on small paper, so between that and the dimly lit dining room, my old eyes had a little bit of difficulty reading the menu. Everything here is basically small plates and our waiter recommended getting 5-6 things for the two of us. We actually wound up going with the ""7-course"" menu, which was $45 per person. We were warned that food will come out as it's ready and won't come out in any particular order. What we didn't expect was our first item to arrive about 3 minutes after we placed or order! And it generally didn't slow down from that point forward. We basically got through the 7-courses plus dessert in a little over 30 minutes! We never felt rushed per se and we usually had a few minutes in between courses. After the first four courses, I was getting worried that I might walk out hungry, but happily I can say that was not the case. I was full, but not stuffed. Everything we had was simply amazing. We had the Shrimp Egg Rolls, Crab Wonton Taco, Szechuan Chicken Satay, Cheesesteak Bao Buns, Soy Glazed Chilean Sea Bass, Kim Chee Fried Rice, Filet Migon, and Ice Cream for dessert.

A lot of Chinese restaurants have tacky interior...but the inside of this place is SEVERELY outdated, everything is janky and the workers eye you like hawks. I never really feel comfortable here. We had a few weird occurrences, but I shall not get into detail about that lol...just be warned if you are a person of color, AND It's actually ironic because I'm mixed with Asian. Let's just say we got accused of not tipping, and someone ran out after us. After that incident (which happened a year ago) we haven't gone back till this last weekend, just more cautious this time. The prices have significantly gone up. We got three dishes and the total came up to $70, which INCLUDES a tip they added. For all that we could have just went out to eat at a nicer restaurant and felt more comfortable!!! This WILL definitely be the last time we come to this establishment. 

So you wonder why we decided to go back?
Well, besides all the shenanigans...the food is actually pretty good. It's the only comforting thing about this place, and the reason why I am rating Jade Harbor with two stars.

The ambiance is nice inside, think dimly lit and very wood heavy interior. Almost like a whiskey bar feel I think. Went in a group of 6 - make sure to have a reservation for a group otherwise on the weekends seems like they're pretty packed throughout the night.

We ordered some cocktails and ciders, specifically the tuxedo drink on special, the hilltop pop, and the once upon a thyme in Mexico. Cocktails to me were a bit average compared to other cocktail bars but I guess good for a restaurant bar. Service was also good. Our waitress was very cute and knowledgeable about all the dishes and drink items.

Thoughts on the food we had:
-veal tartare: I really liked this dish for the larger chunks of veal. My boyfriend however was expecting more of a ground/minced tartare
-duck agnolotti: SO GOOD. My favorite dish of the night. Basically like little mini raviolis stuffed with duck in a leek sauce reduction.
-bucatini: standard red sauce pasta dish I think. Noodles were too cooked and not al dente enough
-margherita pizza: also standard. Their pizzas seem to be neopolitan style
-speck and egg pizza: loved this! The caramelized onions enhanced the flavors I think
-hanger steak: well cooked steak. Perfectly medium rare but I think it was too salty. Looked like they sprinkled kosher on top of the steak and potatoes before serving the dish, could have done with less salt or no salt added. The shishito peppers helped cut the saltiness of the steak. The potatoes were a bit too well done for my taste. Couldn't feel a difference between the fried exterior and the interior of the potato slices
(Our friends also had the trout and the scallops. Heard the scallops were very good)

Overall, good food and drinks. Nice ambiance. But I think a bit overpriced for what it is. I would go back for the duck agnolotti and the speck and egg pizza for sure and will probably have to try some other dishes.",Wm Mulherin's Sons,19122,"{'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'GoodForDancing': 'False', 'RestaurantsReservations': 'True', 'GoodForKids': 'False', 'WiFi': ""u'free'"", 'NoiseLevel': ""u'average'"", 'OutdoorSeating': 'True', 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '3', 'HasTV': 'False', 'Ambience': ""{'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'classy': True, 'casual': False}"", 'BestNights': ""{'monday': False, 'tuesday': False, 'friday': True, 'wednesday': False, 'thursday': True, 'sunday': False, 'saturday': True}"", 'WheelchairAccessible': 'True', 'DogsAllowed': 'False', 'RestaurantsAttire': ""'casual'"", 'Alcohol': ""u'full_bar'"", 'BikeParking': 'True', 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': 'True', 'Music': ""{'dj': False, 'background_music': False, 'no_music': False, 'jukebox': False, 'live': False, 'video': False, 'karaoke': False}"", 'CoatCheck': 'True', 'GoodForMeal': ""{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': None, 'dinner': True, 'brunch': None, 'breakfast': False}"", 'Smoking': ""u'no'"", 'BusinessParking': ""{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}"", 'HappyHour': 'False', 'RestaurantsTableService': 'True', 'Caters': 'False', 'RestaurantsDelivery': 'True', 'RestaurantsTakeOut': 'True', 'BusinessAcceptsBitcoin': 'False'}","Restaurants, Tapas/Small Plates, Italian, Szechuan, Cocktail Bars, Pizza, Chinese, Bars, Nightlife",0.3082278911564626,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Wm Mulherin's Sons,19122,North,0.3082278911564626,0.9972,0.3082278911564626

Party or family dinner should included soda because it's $358 dollars per table. Most Chinatown they do most of restaurants,but we want to try the foods there. The manager gave us two glass of ice that they charge us. 20 people two glass of ice and  all other my kids they have to drink hot soda.

I went to Cheu Noodle about a year ago and wasn't super impressed, so I was hesitant to go in. My experience with Bing Bing Dim Sum was much better. I'll have to go to Cheu Noodle again to re-evaluate but until then, I'll review Bing Bing Dim Sum.

Despite it being Saturday afternoon, we were seated right away. The food came out very quickly and steaming out each time. For every dish, at least one or two servers came to see how we were doing. The customer service was great and the food was delicious.

What we ordered: 

Pork Soup Dumplings (4): miso soup dumplings.

4 dumplings were served quickly in a steamer. They were very juicy and quite flavorful. I liked them with a little sauce from the caterpillar bread.

Turnip Cake: matzo, fried egg, maple soy, bonito

Probably the best dish that we ordered. I'm wasn't sure if I had a turnip cake before, but I'll definitely be ordering them in the future. The turnip is mixed with matzah and drizzled with a maple soy glaze. It's topped with bonito and an egg. The over-easy egg makes the entire dish come together.

Cheesesteak Bao (2): Cooper sharp, long hots, wit.

How can you come to South Philly and not order a cheesesteak? This perfect twist on an American classic. The bao was stuffed with shredded meat, cheese, and peppers. The sweetness of the dough really hit the spot for complimenting the savory filling.


Caterpillar Bread: BBQ pork, caramelized honey, sesame

This was a close 2nd for the best dish we had. The BBQ pork and honey really went well with each other. Each bite with sweet and savory and a little bit of heaven. I would strongly suggest ordering this dish if you go to Bing Bing.

Overall, our experience here was really pleasant. The food was delicious and reasonably priced. The service was exceptional and I'm over here drooling over our dim sum selections while I type this blog up.

(+) lobster chow fun - I'm a huge fan of the thick rice noodles so I was very excited for this! The lobster was tender and there was a good amount and the flavor/texture of the noodles was really yummy. The addition of jicama made the dish unique.
(neutral) edamame dumplings - while they were soft and the broth was tasty, I've had edamame dumplings done better at other spots and for a cheaper price
(neutral) mapo tofu - a twist on the typical mapo tofu appetizer, they had crisps on the top of diced tofu pieces - definitely didn't taste bad but tasted veryyyyy different from the traditional mapo tofu so I'm not sure if I would order it again
(+) icecream sushi - a really fun dish to order with friends and has a great chocolate sauce!

Well the dish was delicious. Since seafood is my thing and shrimp is the best in the seafood game. I knew that I prolly would like it being as tho I rarely met a shrimp I didn't like.

My honey walnut shrimp had a nice crispy coating on the outside that was sweet but not too sweet. The glazed walnuts was the perfect consistency, it definitely added great flavor to the shrimp. Overall I think the honey walnut shrimp would pair well with rice or a side salad.

Great service, the line moved really fast even during lunch hour. My dish was pretty pricey. I paid about 14.00 for my side only but for the quality of the flavor.

NOM WAH!

I love Nom Wah, and it's proven to be a consistently good spot for dim sum, drinks, and more. I love it for many reasons: It's clean, they're quick, they're friendly, they have a full bar, they have a great menu, it's an awesome value, and THEY TAKE RESERVATIONS! 

Amazing. What more could you want?

My favorites are the soup dumplings, the spicy wontons, and the shrimp rice rolls. You can't beat the price for the amount of food you get here. Dim Sum done right.

Ordered the beef combo, veggie combo, pork belly and some noodles with the original and tonkotsu miso soup. 

The beef and pork came out significantly earlier than everything else, about fifteen minutes and talking to the waiter before the vegetables came, and then asking again before the noodles came. Not sure if this was done on purpose so we would order more meat dishes, but it really makes a worse hot pot experience to burn through the meat before being able to eat it with anything else. It also made it difficult to take advantage of the conveyor belt offerings since we couldn't really assess how much food we ordered. 

The conveyor belt is a neat gimmick. The hot pot broth was also pretty good. Their house sauce is not bad. 

The quality of meat is high, and it tasted maybe better, but the hot pot experience is fine with just regular beef so I can't say it was worth it

I couldn't remember why I hadn't returned because I remember the food being good. I saw a late reservation slot open last weekend and decided to give it a go. 

Well, once the first dish arrived, I remembered why. The bass tartare was $18 and only about a tablespoon of chopped fish. While it was good, it wasn't amazing and worth the price tag. Other restaurants give you way more for that price. The cheese ravioli with favas had nice texture, but again, very small and pricey. It also was a little too salty due to all the cheese both outside and inside. 

The pizza isn't cheap, but is standard dinner prices for the city. The asparagus and ferns white pizza was excellent with lots of greens and flavor. It was perfectly seasoned with a nice wood oven crust and not too salty. I would order this again. 

Our bill was around $90 before tip, and my husband was still hungry. Service was also terrible for this price point. When I asked questions about the menu, ""Can you tell me about the bass tartare?"" I got generic answers, ""It's bass tartare. Chopped up bass."" Yeah, I know what that is, but when I'm paying $18 for an appetizer, I want a description. Is there a sauce? An oil? Seasoning? Portion size? The worst was when we finished our food, I asked for a dessert menu. It was 11:02 PM. She said the kitchen was closed. Okay, fine but what kind of place doesn't do last call/order? Even dive bars give you a heads up when the kitchen is closing. The service was incredibly disappointing, especially at this price point. 

Drinks were on point though. My mezcal green pepper cocktail was well crafted and a good pour. My husband loved his whiskey based cocktail. I recommend going for drinks and pizza if you aren't looking to spend a lot of cash.

Walked in and the environment was neat and inviting. We had a party of 7 and we were seated on a round table that allowed us to have great conversation and enjoy our dining experience together.

We elected to do the full dining experience which consisted of the carved meats as well as the salad bar. The salad bar was full of choices all fresh and presented elegantly. They provide you with some appetizers to help you get started. Cheese bread and fried bananas. Delicious. 

The waiters come by offering you different cuts of meats. They place the rack on the table, carve a portion, and you use your tong to place on your plate. They came around frequently and we were able to try out a variety of meat flavors, baked pineapple, chicken, and salmon.

Hint: If you don't get the cuts you want or the particular meat item listed as a choice, just ask your waiter and they will put your request in. Dessert is an additional charge, just be aware.

Once seated, we were told to choose a broth and went with the original which was rich and flavorful. The broth was really decadent and pairs well with the beef combo that we got.

This is a must try if looking for pan-Asian food in center city, and their happy hour is fantastic if you are sitting in the bar area. It's also small plates/tapas style, which is my preferred serving method because I can never make up my mind. Weekend nights are typically crowded and I recommend making a reservation before visiting. The restaurant has a loungey feel with a buzzing atmosphere. The service is always very speedy and we were impressed with our last server's knowledge of the cocktail menu! 

We started off with some drinks (shocking) and had asked the server if any of the cocktails were spicy because we are huge spice people. She recommended the Kantoi Road, which was made with tequila and charred chili peppers - wow this drink was fantastic and my new fav! If you are a fan of spicy margs this drink is for you. The friend I was with ordered an Emperors Garden, which had aloe and cucumber in it, and was very refreshing. 

I don't have any pictures of the food we ordered because I was hangry (phones don't always eat first).
We started off with the pork bao buns, Korean bbq beef satay, and the Brussels sprouts. As I previously mentioned, I am still thinking about the bao buns because they were THAT good. The bbq beef was flavorful and the Brussels sprouts were cooked perfectly + I loved the chili sauce they were in. Next we ordered cheesesteak bao, Szechuan chicken stir-fry, and kimchee fried rice. I'd recommend the pork bao buns over the cheesesteak ones. My other favorite item of the night was the kimchee fried rice - it was yummy and you get a nice size portion for the price.

I have been coming here for years, mainly for the roti canai. It is a no frills  establishment in Chinatown that has been around forever. The decor is very industrial and functional. It gets busy and loud so keep that in mind if choosing this restaurant for your occasion. The staff's friendliness is hit or miss but they all hustle and work hard. Easy to do individual dishes or family style.

Every meal I get here starts with the roti canai. Flaky yet moist layered bread with a chicken and potato dipping sauce. The perfect combo of cinnamon and savory spices. We followed this with the mango chicken. This is always a favorite as the tart sauce complements the sweetness of the mango. We tried a new dish for us, the Beef Rendang. A good flavor profile with cinnamon and clove yet still somehow savory. This dish did disappoint as the texture was as if it had been sitting for some time or came out of the freezer.

MENU: Spectacular. So many great vegan options. Tons of dim sum and all sorts of awesome appetizer and entrée dishes. They also had all kinds of smoothies and juices and teas. 

FOOD: So good! I tried (all vegan): hot and sour soup, BBQ pork, fried scallops, vegetable dumplings, shrimp dumplings, meat dumplings, spring roll, and string beans. Everything was absolutely delicious (excellent flavor and texture). 

PRICES: Very affordable. Dim sum is a great way to try multiple dishes without spending a lot. They also have lunch specials.

Lets compare to the competitors in Chinatown:

Price: $24 dinner, $18 lunch, the price is pretty much the same as Nine Ting, Hippot, etc.
Quality: Much, much higher than the other AYCE places; the fatty brisket is to die for but I also really like the spicy beef and huge assortment of other options. The flounder. Don't be sleeping on the flounder. The fish at this location is just so tender and flaky. Not sure what they put in the fish but my friends and I absolutely loved it.
Assortment: I think this is really what makes this place the best bang for your buck. There's literally four pages full of different items to pick from including everything from fish, to many many different types and cuts of meat, to fish balls, tofu, veggies, etc. literally probably 3-4x the amount of different menu items compared to the other AYCE spots and yet much higher quality.

We ordered the Beef with Chinese Vegetables and the Home Style Jumbo Shrimp & Scallops. Between the two of the dishes the best part were the shrimp, but that was just about it. The shrimp were huge and very flavorful. However, the flavoring of the sauces of both dishes were very bland and barely appetizing. The scallops were practically flavorless and the beef was just okay.

The servers and staff are very friendly every time I go they are attentive and informative and give out great recommendations. Ask away and they are helpful and will make sure your dining experience is satisfactory.

I've only tried their hotpot so far and my go-to flavor is the tomato oxtail. They bring around the seasonings so you can add and adjust to your taste.  I love the conveyor belt idea (the past 2 times I've been there they ran out of some additions on the conveyor belt and didn't have the tomato oxtail I wanted which was a bummer but I managed to substitute with other things).

I would like to give them a 5-star rating, but there was a couple of things that made the experience a little uncomfortable or offsetting. 

First the booths are very small. There's not much wiggle room. They even acknowledge as much by building in these table extenders to allow for some more table space. There's really no great way to put everything on the table at the same time when you're in a party of four. 

The sauce tray isn't as accessible. I've been to other hot pot places where there is a sauce bar. You can go there whenever you want to refill your sauce cup. At Chubby Cattle, you have to ask the server to get it for you. It adds a layer of inconvenience, but that's all. 

There's also some sort of member club that gives you 20% off conveyor items, but that offer was currently suspended. Also almost everything Wagyu was not available (except the brisket and later I found the dumplings on the conveyor belt). 

Lastly, the conveyor belt has lots of items for you to throw in the hot pot. A little offsetting for me is that some of the items were sitting a shallow pool of water. I value that everything is thoroughly washed, but maybe it needs to be drained better. 

Overall, it was a great experience. I really enjoyed my tomato oxbone broth and could consume it by itself. I've really just scratched the service of the full experience here.

We ended up ordering the Jumbo Shrimp and Scallop. The flavor of the Shrimp was ok but the scallop was like eating a mixture between a dish sponge and potato.

I love walking around here and checking out all of the different stalls, from different types of honey to different jams to spices (check out The Head Nut) and cooked food.

There's something very homey about eating at a family-run Chinatown restaurant that turns out simple yet tasty plates of authentic Szechuan food. The ""small eats"" or appetizer-style dishes shared family-style are my favorite part of this mouth-numbing cuisine! We started with the Chengdu-style cold bean noodles, and the soft, slippery noodles were a great conduit for the slightly spicy chili sauce. The dan dan noodles with minced pork were a bit of a miss--the wheat noodles seemed a bit overcooked, and the sauce was rather flavorless. Similarly, the mapo tofu with ground meat was surprisingly bland and the sauce was way too soupy. The smashed cucumbers in vinegar/soy garlic sauce were tasty and refreshing, but the highlight dish here (also the owner's favorite dish) was the beef, tripe, and tendon in chili oil (fuqi feipian). The thin, cold slices of brisket and offal were tossed with a delicious chili sauce and had a great lean texture! Nice!

Overall, all the dishes here had very clean flavors and were surprisingly mild for something branded as Szechuan cuisine (I barely got any of the characteristic numbing spice). However, this also meant that nothing was overly salty, and the great value food and friendly service made this an authentic, homey experience!",Delightful Garden,19107,"{'GoodForKids': 'True', 'RestaurantsTableService': 'True', 'RestaurantsTakeOut': 'True', 'OutdoorSeating': 'False', 'NoiseLevel': ""u'average'"", 'RestaurantsAttire': ""u'casual'"", 'GoodForMeal': ""{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': False, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}"", 'RestaurantsReservations': 'True', 'BikeParking': 'True', 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': 'True', 'RestaurantsDelivery': 'True', 'BusinessParking': ""{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}"", 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'Music': ""{'dj': False, 'background_music': False, 'no_music': False, 'jukebox': False, 'live': False, 'video': False, 'karaoke': False}"", 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '2', 'Ambience': ""{'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': False}"", 'GoodForDancing': 'False', 'HasTV': 'True', 'HappyHour': 'False', 'WiFi': ""'no'"", 'Alcohol': ""'none'""}","Food, Chinese, Karaoke, Nightlife, Desserts, Restaurants, Szechuan",0.24557692307692308,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Delightful Garden,19107,Center,0.24557692307692308,0.9938,0.24557692307692308

It's cheap, it's delicious, it's fast.  The ambiance is lacking and the service can be a little more ""efficient,"" but it makes for a great lunch.  It's also cash only!

Pros:

The soup dumpings are delicious - vegetable, pork, crab, spicy - you name it and they're quite good!  Additionally, the Shao Mai was a delightful little surprise I had never ordered here before.  

It's fairly inexpensive, with an order of 6-8 soup dumpings ranging from 6-8 dollars.  

Service was typical for a packed house, but the group seemed to communicate well and delivered the food fast!

Cons:

The place is busy and often hard to get a table for a larger group at all and certainly during the busy times.  That's probably more to their credit than a true ""con.""  

The ambiance is certainly far from fancy or even ""nice.""  Plastic tables, foggy water glasses, and a kitchen in front of you as you walk by (close enough that you could reach out and steal a bun if you wanted!).  The cleanliness looks suspect, but it's hard to question the freshness at which the food is prepared!

I found the Pork buns to be overly doughy and lacking a filling pork and the hot and sour soup was a bit too viscous for my liking, but was sufficient spicy and filling!

Conclusion:  

Cheap, delicious and made-to-order Dim Sum makes Dim Sum Garden a quick go-to for a fun lunch.

We always get beef combo cause it comes with 3 different kinds of beef. Good quality, me likey. Also IG worthy cause of the presentation haha

Tried duck flippers for the first time in my life. It's crunchy. Kinda in between pig ear, tendon & tripe lol. I wouldn't order it again but at least i can say I've tried it!

I love that they bring the whole shabang of condiments for you to mix it in your ponzu(citrus soy sauce). Huge star for having chopped Thai chilies. It's the main ingredient in all of my sauces!

Tomato oxtail broth is my personal favorite, extremely flavorful. Anything oxtail really, i love it all lol. If you're lucky, you'll actually get an oxtail in the soup. I like to suck the marrow out of it. Y U M !

I've sat at the 4 seater booths next to the conveyor belt every visit. BE CAREFUL getting in & out of those; my girl hit her leg pretty hard on the edge. You can order veggies from the menu or just grab it from the belt. Items on belt are in a smaller portion. Prices are listed below the belt.

Buddakan's reputation proceeds it in many ways - from the ambiance, the food, the vibes, the drinks, the prices... yet we were still all beyond impressed with our entire dining experience.

We decided to follow the waitress recommendation and dine mostly family style.  We ordered some apps plus about 1 entree for each person, but mostly shared our dishes.  Some exclusions since we had some vegetarian eaters and ordered 1-2 meat dishes.  I managed to taste everything and each was better than the next! 

To start, we ordered 3 appetizers -
// Edamame Dumplings ($16) truffled sauternes-shallot broth.  I believe these came 5 to an order and we added one, but I can't be exactly certain.  These were quite possibly the best thing on the table all night.  Fluffy clouds of whipped edamame encased in tender dumpling dough - oh my goodness.  We took one bite of these and quickly contemplated ordering 5 more orders and feasting on these alone.  Not going to lie, we came pretty close, but in the end we refrained.
// Mushroom Potstickers ($12) mushroom mix, pickled lotus root ponzu sauce.  These were phenomenal as well! A bit crispy on the outside, it was a nice comparison to the soft dumpling texture.  They were earthy, flavorful, and fantastic.  Almost a meat-like texture from the mushrooms, and a definite crowd pleaser.
// Tuna Tartare Spring Rolls ($16) served with crispy shallot, chili ponzu.  Three came to an order for these guys, so we ordered 2 orders since there were 6 of us.  I didn't actually get to eat this one, because at 8 months pregnant I know I shouldn't be eating Tuna tartare (although I was VERY tempted) - the general consensus from the table was that these were amazeballs.  Thankfully, someone graciously offered to eat mine. 

The dinner entrees were fantastic.  My friend and myself ended up splitting most of the Sea bass as our main dish which was amazing.  Thoughts on all the dishes below:
// Pan Seared Sea Bass ($37: haricots verts, butternut squash, maitake mushrooms, truffle jus).  AMAZING.  I've had a thing for fish lately, and this one was stellar.  The sea bass was super thick and delicious, a beautiful crust on top with perfectly flaky and juicy center - YUM.  The verts and mushrooms added a nice element to the dish too! The fish was super flavorful without being overly salty, which I sometimes find, especially in asian cuisine. 
// Shrimp Lo Mein ($23: x.o. sauce, scallions). YUM. I was worried that the shrimp lo mein and the shrimp pad thai would be similar, but they were both very different in flavor, noodle texture, etc.  The shrimp wasn't a side-kick in this dish, it definitely stood up on the main stage - so delicious! 
// Shrimp Pad Thai ($27: shrimp, bean sprouts). Again another delicious dish.  Pad Thai usually seems like the safe and go-to choice for those who don't like thai food, so it's not typically my order.  However, this dish shone bright, and was super flavorful.  The shrimp was delicious, and didn't cower down in comparison to the rest of the dishes. 
// Black Pepper Beef ($30: wok tossed rib eye, crispy bird's nest).  Truthfully, I wasn't the most interested in this dish, because it was pretty basic - but I tried a piece of the meat - it was delicious! It a bit on the sweet side but nice and peppery as well.  The crispy birds nest was an interesting addition as well.
/// Crab fried rice: We ordered this after most of our plates  were on the table.  One of the girls in the group wanted it - honestly, I though 'who orders fried rice?!' but.... wouldn't you know it, this was damn delicious.  We all started out by saying we just wanted a small bite to try, then everyone (EVERYONE) took more and more.  It was the first dish completely finished on the table! 

There might have been more on the table, but the other dishes escape me. I just know everything I tried was incredible.  They even had mocktails listed on their menu - I had one, and asked the bartended to make it 'less sweet' - it was delicious, and I felt like I was part of the gang with everyone having a cocktail.  

Our waitress was absolutely great - she answered all our questions, and silently giggled when she overheard our typical bachelorette-y conversations.  At the end of the meal, she even brought out a dairy free coconut sorbet with a sparkler candle in it for our bride.  We obviously all shared the sorbet, and it was light, delicious, and so yummy!  We couldn't even fathom looking at the dessert menu, but I'm certain that it is probably choc-full of wonderful delicacies.

My one complaint, would be we were seated next to the kitchen - right by the open flame and plate warmers.  It was a bit warm for my taste, but thankfully we were dressed for the 96+ degree day outside.  Still, I would have preferred to be a bit further from the kitchen.  The plus side was that we had a circle booth which was GREAT for table conversation and seating.",Buddakan,19106,"{'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'GoodForKids': 'False', 'Corkage': 'True', 'Caters': 'False', 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '3', 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': 'True', 'WiFi': ""u'no'"", 'RestaurantsReservations': 'True', 'BusinessParking': ""{'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}"", 'Alcohol': ""'full_bar'"", 'BikeParking': 'True', 'BYOBCorkage': ""'yes_corkage'"", 'RestaurantsAttire': ""'dressy'"", 'BYOB': 'False', 'RestaurantsTakeOut': 'True', 'Ambience': ""{'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': True, 'upscale': False, 'classy': True, 'casual': False}"", 'RestaurantsCounterService': 'True', 'RestaurantsDelivery': 'True', 'HasTV': 'False', 'WheelchairAccessible': 'True', 'HappyHour': 'True', 'GoodForMeal': ""{'dessert': None, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': True, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}"", 'DogsAllowed': 'False', 'RestaurantsTableService': 'True', 'OutdoorSeating': 'True', 'NoiseLevel': ""u'loud'""}","Restaurants, Asian Fusion, Chinese",0.32795013628346953,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Buddakan,19106,Center,0.32795013628346953,0.9997,0.32795013628346953

I lived in China from '09-'14 and the kind of skewered meat (and other options, but really it's all about that lamb) was a constant source of snacking joy, with nights at outdoor night markets often revolving around them and endless Tsingtaos. I include that to say I love Chinese skewers.

This place looks good from the outside - it's small, a little dingy looking maybe but in an appealing way. I pass by it all the time and it always seems like people are enjoying themselves over beers, conversation, and skewers. 

Well I went in once last year by myself and found that it was ok, but nothing that blew me away. The portions of meat on the skewers wasn't amazing by greedy American standards, but neither are they always in China. The difference here is that they're at American prices, which makes me want a bit more. But even with that in mind, I went there with a visiting friend from the old China days and wound up passing because of how unfriendly and unaccomodating the employee was to us. We went in, greeted her in Mandarin (we're both capable speakers) and asked if they sold beer. When she said no, we asked if we could bring some in since people always seem to be living it up in there when I walk by. She grumpily laid down a hard rule that each of us could bring one. We went out to check out TT Skewer on 9th Street. The kicker was that later on that night, we walked by again thinking they might still be open...and the door was unlocked and full of Chinese folks whooping it up over, you guessed it, skewers and drinks. They then told us they were closed and shooed us out.

So we get an unfriendly place that serves not-nearly-the-best of their product in a one-block radius.

Not mind-blowing, but a very solid Shanghainese restaurant. The soup dumplings are flavorful and have a relatively thin skin. I personally think they're better than the ones at Dim Sum Garden. I also got the pan fried soup dumplings (sheng jian bao) and they were decent. The beef scallion pancakes are also yummy, though oily. Finally, we ordered the braised pork belly (hong shao rou), a Shanghainese classic and childhood favorite of mine. Understandably, it took longer to come out than our other dishes, so be aware that it takes a while to cook. I compare every pork belly to what my mom makes, and this one is (almost) just as good! Great flavor on the sauce and the pork belly is tender, though it could have been even just a little more so. Pro tip, mix the extra sauce with your rice. Don't let any of that deliciousness go to waste! 

Service here is surprisingly good for a Chinese restaurant. We were able to get both hot tea and cold water. It's actually lemon water and comes in a mason jar, a nice touch.

Nan Zhou Hand Drawn Noodle House is located in Chinatown, next door to Dim Sum Garden and 2 doors down from The Halal Guys. 

My husband and I came here a few minutes before 8 pm on a Friday night and were seated immediately. But we were lucky to get a table because it didn't look like there were any other tables left. 

Anyways, we were given menus and then ended up ordering:

Taro Smoothie, $3.25 prior to tax- My husband ordered this. This drink was on the sweet side and would ask if the sweetness level can be adjusted. Also this drink was powdery at times and would not recommend getting drinks here. 

Bok Choy With Fresh Garlic, $8.95 prior to tax- Tasty bok choy that is large enough to share with 4 people. Great garlic flavor but was oily. We did not finish this and had leftovers. 

Noodle With Peanut Sauce, $4.25 prior to tax- I opted for this dish since I prefer dry style noodles over noodles in a soup. I decided to get my noodles hand drawn (or hand pulled). But you can also choose knife cut, which makes for an even chewier texture. I liked the sauce that was used in this dish. Although this dish appears to be small, it was a perfect size for one person. 

Beef Tendon Noodle Soup, $8.50 prior to tax- My husband ordered this, as a recommendation from our friend who has dined here a few years before. He opted for the hand drawn style noodles too and thought it was a good texture for him. The tendons were tender and the soup was flavorful. A great portion for one but really could be shared with another person. 
------------------------
(Total= $26.95 after tax, prior to tip)

Service was fine for the most part. We had our water glasses refilled during our meal and we had dirty dishes removed. Employees did also check up on us more than once during our dining experience. 

Overall, the food was delicious, the price was pretty reasonable and I would come back here again if I was visiting Philadelphia again.

service is slow here, i had to flag down my server multiple times but once i did and put all my orders in, the experience got better. the prices here match the quality which i love! 

the crystal shrimp dumplings and the shrimp fried rice were my favorite dishes here. 

HOUSE SPECIAL BUN: this comes out as just one bun. insides were kind of gross. but the buns itself were steamed well but i would not order this again

SOUP DUMPLINGS: these are smaller than i'm used to and less broth but for me personally, i like that the whole thing can fit in my mouth into nice one bite! i would def get these again

STICKY RICE: this was good definitely ordering this again

GENERAL TSO's CHICKEN: this was subpar and also a small portion to share between 4 people. i'll definitely try another protein dish next tie

Heard plenty of good things, but it just didn't do it for me. Came in on a Friday around dinner time. We were seated quickly with a reservation at a table by the bar. I ordered a bourbon cocktail, which was pretty tasty but extremely small that it almost felt awkward picking up the glass.

We ordered the seafood mixto, cacio e pepe, and speck & egg pizza. Figured an appetizer, pasta, and main would've been sufficient. We were wrong. While everything tasted good, portions were tiny for the price point. After we ordered, bread came out, portioned by slice based on how many people were at the table... I know some places do this, but it was almost ironic as it set the stage for what was to come for the rest of our meal.

The seafood mixto was served in something smaller than a dip bowl. Again, taste was on point, but portion was just way too small. Next, the pizza, which was the highlight of the meal. If you're hungry, definitely order a pizza as it's reasonably sized and easy to share. Finally, the pasta, which despite my best efforts to eat slowly, was finished in 2 minutes. We asked for another menu but didn't get one until 15 minutes later. By that time, we decided to keep our money and eat something at home.

You can either have your server add and mix everything for you, or do it yourself. Service was also pretty good. They refilled my water when needed.

I got fish with sour cabbage rice noodle soup. For the price, the portion was pretty generous and there was a lot of fish. According to the menu it's pretty spicy but I didn't think it was that spicy at all. Even so I thought it was pretty good. My friend got the spicy szechuan soup and there was a lot of beef!! If you want to eat a lot of meat and like spicy food you should get that.

I'd come back to try the other soup bases.",Shi Miao Dao Yunnan Rice Noodle,19107,"{'GoodForMeal': ""{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': False, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}"", 'RestaurantsDelivery': 'True', 'RestaurantsTakeOut': 'True', 'RestaurantsTableService': 'True', 'WheelchairAccessible': 'False', 'HasTV': 'True', 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '2', 'WiFi': ""u'free'"", 'NoiseLevel': ""u'average'"", 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'False', 'Ambience': ""{'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'classy': True, 'casual': False}"", 'BusinessParking': ""{u'valet': False, u'garage': None, u'street': None, u'lot': False, u'validated': None}""}","Noodles, Restaurants, Chinese",0.22161654135338343,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Shi Miao Dao Yunnan Rice Noodle,19107,Center,0.22161654135338343,0.9948,0.22161654135338343

The restaurant is a bit smaller than your typical dim sum palace. There are just a handful of tables on the main floor, with a few more in the basement. But it's a nice place if you want a more intimate experience. Plus, the decor is fun and the staff are friendly.

The food itself is why you come, though, and I can happily say that the food here does not disappoint. We enjoyed a feast of shumai, har gow, sticky rice, lotus leaf rice, bao, bok choy, spare ribs, soup dumplings, rice noodle rolls, turnip cakes, scallion pancakes, and more. Everything was amazing, and writing it down right now made me crave it all again! They don't have carts here - you need to order off the menu - which is a bit of a bummer, but it means all the food is fresh and delicious.

The space is small and the upper level has more seating. The decor is modern which I appreciate as it doesn't give off a typical Taiwanese/Chinese restaurant ""feels"". 

My two friends and I ordered several different small plates and entrees to share. My favorites were the pork belly with garlic chili oil, the pickled Szechuan shrimp and the snow pea leaves. I like how they didn't overcook the snow pea where it becomes soggy and drench in oil. The shrimp was cooked perfectly with the right amount of flavors. The pork belly was melt in your mouth spicy good. That dish might have been my star on the table. 

Unfortunately, I wasn't a fan of their version of dan dan noodles. It had an unusual peanut taste, which I'm not used to when it comes to dan dan noodles. Also, it was lacking in flavor. The spicy cucumbers were refreshing. The spicy wontons had spiciness and flavor. I'm just used to the wonton skins being thinner in texture with this dish.

These are all not bad. The reasons that I gave 3 stars are: (1) foods are expensive and not up to the quality I expected. I ordered a shrimp pad Thai and an appetizer of Mapo tofu. The sauce for both dishes tasted the same except a little spicier for the mapo tofu. (2) Foods are served in small portion. Be ready to order more than one dish if you want to have a full meal. Foods are served in tapa plate. Interestingly, sides are bigger portion than a ""full plate"" meal and they are cheaper too. It's a busy night and it took us a bit to get the order and the bill though we're not in hurry so I was okay with it.

Love these flavors, which I was first introduced to overseas, and coming here let's me get a much-needed fix.  This is probably 3.5 stars, weighing the food and price, but I rounded up.  

The Food: We got the Beef Brisket Noodle Soup ($8.96, A9 on the menu), Chilled Fungus (such a literal translation - it is wooden ear mushrooms.  $7.96, E7 on the menu), and Beef Drypot ($14.96, F1 on the menu).  
The brisket noodle soup was hearty with a rich broth flavor.  This would be perfect on a cold day (it was, unfortunately, the middle of summer). .  Not a TON of meat so manage your expectations, but it was one of the relatively cheaper options, so I can't complain too much.  
The wooden ear mushroom is always fun to eat because of the chewy texture.  This was no different, and it comes loaded with a vinegar/soysauce/garlic sauce and chilled, so it was very refreshing with strong flavor.  Again a little pricey at $8 for just mushrooms, but the mushrooms were big and fresh.
The Beef drypot gave us our much-needed meat fix, and with really good portion (and it should at $15).  In addition to the beef, there are also peanuts and scallion in the dish, and just loaded with dry spices.  I was definitely feeling the heat from the dish, which was perfect, and it's served with white rice to help balance out the flavors.  
Overall, I would return to try some of the rest of their very expansive menu.  

Space and Pace: Relatively small interior, but there was plenty of seating around dinner time.  Modern-ish vibe in a very casual setting, not too much different than a fast casual spot.  Probably a good spot for lunch, and a very casual meal with a small group of friends.  If you want a date spot, Han Dynasty is a better option.

Having lived in China for more than half a year, I can attest that their 紅燒牛肉麵 is very authentic, it was better than any 蘭州拉麵 Lanzhou Lamian chain I've tried during my stay in China. 蘭州拉麵 chains were literally everywhere where I lived, Lanzhou lamian aka hand-pulled noodle is one of the most popular dishes across China. They were mostly owned by Chinese-Muslims, which is why the meat used for the noodle soup is either beef or lamb.

The broth had a great flavor, its spiciness was just right and the exotic flavor of cilantro complimented the soup perfectly.

The entrees were enjoyable, but the dim sum was nothing special.  I'd probably return for another shot at that Philosopher's chicken though!

We visited here as quick stop after my sister's brief graduation ceremony and I wanted to take the family out for a little nearby flavor.  We weren't disappointed, but I find it hard to go back with so many other delicious options nearby and in Chinatown. 

Pros:

The atmosphere is warm, inviting and clean.  While it was (of the smallest) inconvenient to walk upstairs to the restaurant, we were warmly greeted, quickly sat and appropriately waited on.  

Service was very fast and attentive.  Our food came in what felt like maybe 5 minutes (or less).  Almost disconcertingly fast.  I'm not sure how it was cooked that fast (or maybe it wasn't...hmm).  

I had the Philosopher's chicken, a warm, gooey, chipped chicken with a slightly spicy sauce.  It was enjoyable on the bed of white rice and I'd like to have again.  

My family tried other staples including chicken and broccoli and orange chicken.  They found them delicious.

Cons:

Again, the food came out very fast...but weirdly fast.  It's disappoiting that things are basically sitting ready to be sauced and plated that fast.  

We also snagged a few dim sum appetizers.  They were fine but uninspired.  Soup Dumpings were bland and even a spot of chili sauce or garlic sauce didn't save them.  

Prices were fairly high - even 14-16 dollars for a chicken and rice entree seems steep to me.  

Conclusion:  It's hard to nail down Dim Sum House as anything but another sorta mediocre Asian spot.  They've got a few stars on their menu and it's open late, which is great for the local crowds (I'd probably stay away at my advanced age), but the food is uninspired and generally average, especially it's name-sake dim sum.

When we ordered, we (a table of four) shared two orders of the classic DanDan Noodles, the Beef Noodle Soup, a Mini Rice Bowl with Meat Sauce, and Wontons. The food arrived pretty quick and I can definitely say the portions are huge. Price wise, you can expect to pay something similar in Chinatown, but the portions are definitely as big, if not bigger than other noodle places. It was like each bowl of noodles had 1.5-2 heavy handfuls of noodles and I was shocked by also appreciated of it. The portions, in general, were good if not generous. 

Flavor wise, it was good. I dont think we were blown out of the water when it came to flavor. The DanDan Noodles were a huge portion which a good amount of sauce, but the sauce had a weird after taste to me. I'm not sure what it was, but It was kind of bitter or medicinal?-- maybe some sort of fermented ingredient or msg? But honestly? The perfectly cooked, almost al dente, noodles and the other flavors of the sauce kept me going at it. We ended up having to split a lot of the noodles because the portions were so huge. The rice seemed like your standard meat sauce over rice dish, but it was super fragrant and my friend said it was ""quite filling."" The beef noodle soup broth was super savory and satisfying- and they didn't slump on it at all. Huge portion as well. The wontons on the other hand were kind of ehhh. Like they didn't have flavor or seasoning that was crazy or great-- it just tasted like meat and dumpling skins. 

Otherwise, Id still give this place a 4/5. It's definitely like perfect or great, but I would not be opposed to going again if it's on the way to somewhere or if others want to go.

However, their prices are a little outrageous sometimes- the string bean dish is $12. It doesn't have any protein, and that feels steep. I know we are paying for quality, but I think a veggie side shouldn't be more than ten dollars max.

Also, the last time we ordered, the pepper steak was completely different and not good at all. It was way too saucy. This was only the one time, so we weren't sure what happened.

We ordered the 2 orders of the pork soup dumplings, the pickled garlic cucumber, the crystal shrimp dumpling and the veggie fried rice. 

The picked garlic cucumber was one of the highlights, I'd come back just for this. It was flavored really well and added a fresh, cool aspect to the meal. 

The two things that I thought were just okay were the crystal shrimp dumplings and the veggie fried rice. Both were cooked well but lacked flavor. Adding the vinegar chili oil helped bring some flavor to the dish but not sure I would order those again.

Possibly one of the worst dining experiences we've had in Philly. 

Menu recommends that only kids 6 and up cook their own food in the hot pot.  The pot seems far enough away and deep enough that burns are unlikely. I helped my 9 year old with most of the cooking but she grabbed the ladle at one point and by accident dropped it into the soup. Boiling liquid went flying and she now has a second degree (partial thickness) burn on her flank (my wife and I are both pediatricians). 

She was in severe pain and very frightened. Staff hurried over with ice and were very apologetic. 

Of course it was our responsibility as parents as well but this is not appropriate at all for young kids. They really should restrict the age further. They make it seem like kids do this all the time and it's not a problem. 

Manager took off 50% of bill which was probably not enough in my opinion. 

Food we got to eat was good but added up to $100 before too quickly. Not a great value. 

We went on Labor Day Monday. Checked in on Yelp but when we got there and we were first in love, was still 15-20 minute wait for lunch. 

Grossly understaffed on a very busy day. Poor staff was literally running to keep up. The place felt tense and hurried. They did their best but everything came out slow and not together.

Broth, the base lets me know this is a regular hour restaurant and they make the soup not much earlier than customers step into this place which makes it less flavorful.
Sauce bar, it's pretty regular. They can clean it more often if waiters are not busy playing with phones or staring for gratuities.
Food quality, it depends on what you pick. Beef and pork could be good most of the days. They could be more generous with portion due to limited time and price per head. Seafood is something you roll your dice with. My shrimp is not big size at all like they describe on menu. Dumplings are bad and frozen for long time, do not try dumplings.
Service, we were satisfied with our waiter. But only our waiter, not anybody else since nobody willing to help him to take care his table.

I suspect it'll give you the meat sweats just as well as any other similar spot in the city. That being said, it's a good spot for a group. The tables are large and the food keeps on coming until you're ready for it to stop. 

We started at happy hour. Drinks were 1/2 priced which is a good deal but be warned, the second it's done the prices are no joke. The drinks are delicious but also VERY spend-y, even for the city.  

The salad bar was not what I expected. I would probably refer to it as a bar of salads rather than a traditional salad bar. Depending on your interests there may or may not be salads that appeal to you.  At the end of the day, you're not there for the salads so maybe it doesn't matter. There was a good quinoa salad that I liked and they had tomato, mozzarella and basil so I could make my own caprese. I did love that there were rice and beans on the bar as well as a creamy vegetable soup that was quite good.

There was meat... a lot of it. They come and slice it off for you and have a variety of done-ness available each time they came around. Some were better seasoned than others. I particularly liked the garlic seasoned and the picanha. The others were ok but nothing spectacular. That being said, there was a lot of whatever you liked. The variety of sauces on the salad bar were great and, necessary for some of the less interesting/flavorful cuts.

Situated on St. Vincent Street in Northeast Philly between Brous Avenue and Roosevelt Boulevard in Mayfair, it is a large house in a developing Asian neighborhood that puts out trolley carts loaded with small dish treats both savory and sweet, at reasonable prices and with the expected hussle and flow that this dining style uniquely delivers. Admittedly, the aggressive nature of the cart ladies hawking their delicacies takes some getting used to. You have to be able to say ""no"" when you feel overwhelmed by the surrounding din. But, know that slowing down the onslaught is proper, and multiple opportunities will present themselves. Just take what you want in the moment and let the trolley women return when you are ready for more. 

The most important thing at China Gourmet is that they know from dim sum. There are dozens of choices and most of them are good to great. Shrimp and pork shumai, shrimp hargow, beef rice rolls w vinegar, fried stuffed buns, various dumplings, fish filled chili peppers, egg tarts and many others are well prepared and served hot or cold as appropriate. My bowl of congee was also decent with plenty of ground pork and fresh cut scallion on top. There is plenty more, but you get the picture. 

What's even better is the availability of FREE PARKING right in front of the restaurant, and the large Asian supermarket and Vietnamese kitchen right next door. The money saved is like getting a 25% discount off your check! Hard to beat! 

Now that we've experienced the fun and convenience of a strong dim sum morning with grocery shopping for dessert, Chinatown has lost some of its cultural luster for us (not completely).

I'm a huge hot pot fan and had my share of hot pots around Philly. This was probably rated the lowest. Service was great, which upsets me giving them only 2 stars, but the food was just not there.

Came strictly for hotpot with my kids. Prices are similar to other AYCE places, but not everything was included that would have been included at other places.

Broth - the tom yum broth just wasn't there. It was missing spice and the sour taste that a tom yum should have. I had to grab some spice and sauces from the sauce bar to try to give it more flavor. The oxtail broth was decent and filled with more oxtail than others, but again, lacked flavor and was an upcharge. It might have been because the server came by rather early and drowned down the broth with their standard water. My broth wasn't even halfway gone and they came by with the kettle and started pouring.

Choices of meats/hotpot items - there was plenty of choices available, but they had a good amount of stuff that was upcharged. I really wanted tofu skin rolls, but that was additional. For the cuts - the meats were SO THICK! Typical hotpots would dip the beef, swoosh swoosh a tad, take it out, and YUM. I had to leave my beef in here for quite some time as it was like bacon. And bc the meat was very thick, it was hard to chew as well. Shrimp - pass on this! It's not the full sized shrimp that was pictured.

We've come here multiple times for group events. In general, the dumplings have been good, but the rest was lackluster. The shumai is nontraditional, the har gow and the scallion pancakes are so-so, the bao are too bready, and many quintessential dim sum dishes are just missing. Instead, their menu has a lot of so-so generic Chinese dishes, such as chicken stir-fries, noodle dishes, pork skewers, and other random things. These tasted ok, but they definitely didn't fit the dim sum theme.

Service was generally friendly and fast, and the prices were ok (around $15 per person). The venue is also decently nice, though it can get loud when it's full. Also, since it's under a covered stretch of the road, it's not as bright inside.

The lines are crazy during weekends, but you can join their Yelp waitlist and you get a free dish of meat if you wait for more than a certain amount of time (maybe around 15 minutes). The dishes are just the regular ones you'll be able to get in a typical hot pot restaurant, with normal prices. 
There are three complaints though:
1.  I'm definitely not a fan of their spicy soup base, and it's no way near the traditional Szechuan soup base you're able to get in Chinese supermarket
2. They don't have pre-mixed Ma Jiang (sesame sauce) that is used as a dipping sauce in North. When I ask for Fu Ru (bean curd paste), I was told that they don't have any, so I couldn't even make my own dipping sauce.

I've lived in Northern China throughout my childhood and I have developed a fondness for skewers, particularly lamb skewers. What attracted me to Solo was the fact they not only carried the traditional cumin-laced lamb skewers, but also chicken hearts and gizzards, some of my favorite childhood snacks. While the place was completely empty with barely any place to sit down, Solo Skewer is meant for a quick drop and go kinda place. Ironically, since all of the meat are cooked at the spot, be prepared to wait 5-10 minutes for the meat to cook and eat. My favorites is still the gizzards. I think the chicken hearts were a bit undercooked and the lamb a bit too fatty.

Overall, this was a great blast of the past and I do recommend it, especially if you haven't had any comparable experiences.

I was conflicted on what rating to give Spice, because I literally only like two items there. I've tried a bunch of different stuff on their menu over the past year and I generally am not too into their offerings. There's so much great Chinese food in Philly that this place just doesn't cut it for most dishes. The food tends to be super greasy and just low effort overall. 

BUT, that take does not apply to their Dry Pepper Chicken and their Three Pepper Chicken (which is just Dry Pepper Chicken with some chopped up peppers mixed in). These dishes consist of a huge portion of white rice with ultra spicy fried chicken. It's absolutely horrible for you, but it tastes SO good. The chicken is well cooked and that spice mixture is fantastic, I can taste it as I type this, I wish I could mix garlic and peppers as perfectly as they do in these dishes. 

For the soup, I usually get miso. It's pretty good, it honestly used to be really bad, but out of nowhere they upped their soup game. Their version is simple, with only some tofu chunks and seaweed floating in the broth. 

I've never eaten in the restaurant, so I can only speak to the pickup experience. I order online via their website and my food is ready in 15-20 mins. The place is really busy at lunch time, so I think that's pretty good timing. 

As for the rating, I had to go with three stars. I almost went with four stars because I love those two dishes so much, but everything else I've had just wasn't that great.

We also ordered wonton in chili oil. The wonton tasted soggy and was again, in a bowl of chili oil. It was so spicy we couldn't even finish it. (Waitress was yawning when she was taking the order and didn't bother to ask what level of spice we wanted).

I was waiting long periods in between my meats and I was unhappy. The only meat I really got was the top sirloin, everything else, I had to personally ask my waiter to order for me. Not to mention, the meats that I did receive were all so salty. Was so underwhelmed and disappointing. I regret choosing Chima over Fogo! My dad felt embarrassed becuz he was made to feel like he couldnt afford the full churassco and was left waiting for meat constantly and everyone else was getting consistently served. But my servers Gabby and Hamilton were great; I just didn't find worth in the food and the dining experience. Constantly waiting and watching others get meats left and right.

Anyone who follows me knows that Pei Wei is my favorite chain restaurant, and may know that I frequently hit the suburbs to get my fix. A few of those have closed up, but now we have a brand new location right in the heart of Philadelphia's East Market resurgence!

This may not be a typical Pei Wei restaurant, being a smaller location in a shopping food court, but it does include a number of menu highlights - including its most popular appetizers, entrees, noodle & rice bowls, sushi, and drinks. You will have a small wait for the food, but it's never frozen and always freshly made upon your order.

There are few seats in this primary space, but there is plenty of seating just a step away within the mall corridor.

The easy way to access Pei Wei is to enter the Pennsylvania Convention Center entrance on 12th & Market, go down the escalators on the right-hand side, and the Food Court will be straight through the doors (which is also where Jefferson Station is, for Market-Frankford Line).

Unfortunately Pei Wei does not serve its delicious crab wontons or its spectacular Mandarin green tea here, nor do they seem to be a part of the Pei Wei Rewards program (you don't get credit for your meal). Although, many restaurants have similar practices to limit menu & rewards when it comes to their mall or airport locations.

But, what you do get here is Pei Wei's delicious & fresh food at reasonable prices, in the heart of Philadelphia and within steps of your home or office!",Pei Wei,19107,"{'BusinessParking': ""{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}""}","Restaurants, Chinese, Pan Asian, Fast Food, Gluten-Free, Noodles, Asian Fusion",0.21623634302205727,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Pei Wei,19107,Center,0.21623634302205727,0.9185,0.21623634302205727

Food:
Xiao Long Bao Soup Dumplings - have a weirdly acidic aftertaste, definitely could do better at other locations such as Dim Sum Garden, would NOT recommend

Crispy Salted Chicken / Popcorn Chicken (Taiwanese) - pretty good crispy texture, large pieces of chicken with a standard serving size and price, comes with a slightly tangy mayo sauce - partially would recommend

Taiwanese fried rice noodle - also pretty standard quality food, comes with a large serving, has egg, some meat, not overly salted

It also came with onions and assorted vegetables such as mushrooms carrots. The broth was very flavorful and not too spicy. This dish came with udon noodles, but I preferred it with a side of rice.

Overall Value: Wow, such high hopes based on the other reviews - I really don't get it.  Watered-down tasting ""Modern Asian"" food (whatever that means) at a price that just isn't worth it (not even at restaurant week prices).  Just go to Han Dynasty or any number of places in Chinatown and get the good stuff.  

The Food:  This was $35/person restaurant week prix fixe menu. For the most part, it was aggressively bland and underwhelming.  I know the quality usually takes a bit of a dip during restaurant week, but wow I cannot imagine ever paying full price for this stuff. 
Tuna Pizza: The bread on this was way too thick and flavorless, totally masking the flavor of any tuna.  Could have used a spicy mayo or something to inject some flavor.
Chicken & Ginger Dumplings: Also pretty bland, even with the dipping sauce.  They were fine, just not as good as run-of-the mill Chinatown spots. 
Pan Seared Bass: This one really disappointing, because the reviews were all so positive.  The fish and every component on the plate were just so bland, like they were afraid of flavor.  The fish was very tender, which was nice.  But removing the skin - and thus, no crispy skin on what is normally like a $37 dish - should be a criminal offense.  
Beef Chow Fun:  This was actually pretty good - the beef short rib is rich in flavor and a little goes a long way.   Also decent portion and good chew to the noodle.  That said, the flavor was a touch bland, and no way is this worth a price premium.  
Dip Sum Doughnuts:  These were really good, although I really didn't get any ""five spice"" flavor.  They just tasted like regular sugar doughnuts (albeit really good sugar doughnuts), so if you do come, you should definitely get these.  Pillowy soft + variety of dipping sauces is a win.  That said, no way are these worth $12(?!) normally.  They aren't revolutionary or mind blowing, they are just good sugar doughnuts.
Candy Bar: This was not very good.  Waaaay too dense and too sweet, with nothing to cut the sweetness or balance the dish in any way.

Space and Pace:  Super modern atmosphere plus giant Buddha.  Having a giant Buddha seems pretty cultural appropriation-y to me, but if you're going to do it, at least remember to appropriate some flavors while you are at it. Smh.

We came here as a large group for restaurant week and got to feast on many items from the menu. Highlights were the crispy rock shrimp, the salt & pepper seafood, and the cheesesteak bao - all very delicious. Decent items were the edamame dumplings and the Korean bbq beef satay. Disappointments were the Peking duck (not authentic at all) and the shrimp pad thai (just not very good). Overall a high variance on quality from one dish to the next, so be very cautious with what you order.

Unfortunately, our experience with service was not positive. They absolutely refuse to sit a group without everyone there, so even though we knew one of our members would be coming later, we needed to wait for her. The staff were not very polite or helpful about it.

Secondly, the ordering process was unnecessarily complicated. Maybe this is a restaurant-week-specific practice, but we were told we needed to order a seven-course meal as an entire table, and that we would all need to eat the same dishes. This was a bit frustrating, since many of us had different preferences and wanted to try competing items on the menu.

Lastly, the restaurant ambiance wasn't quite my jam. It's very dark with weird purple lighting, which makes it feel like you're eating dinner in a club. For a relatively expensive meal, I would've appreciated a nicer environment.

If you want really authentic Asian food, there is plenty of other places but Buddakan definitely caters to Americans. 

I went for restaurant week. Honestly the food was pretty good, even if not ""traditional"" so I don't have any complaints about that. The bbq pork was delicious, maybe one of my favorite pork dishes I've had in a while. My main complaint is the portion sizes- for the price, you really do not get a ton of food. I went for restaurant week lunch and got 4 courses but my party went out to get second lunch after. 

The pork belly bao was alright at best- nothing special but it wasn't bad either. The Kobe beef slider was also pretty good, but again, not incredible anyway and the portion is tiny- I've had real Kobe steak in japan and it was ok a completely different level, the ""Kobe beef slider"" is basically slightly nicer ground beef. The dip sum donuts are basically fried dough covered in sugar- while the sauces are interesting, it's nothing mind blowing. As I said earlier, the bbq pork is the only thing that stood out. 

Service was okay until we got to dessert- for some reason it took 30 minutes just to make the dessert. We were basically ignored for half an hour while everyone else got their entire meals.

i however did like that they brought out a little 'create your own' sauce selection so you can make your own dipping sauce. i'm personally one of those people who prefers to just let the broth season the ingredients themselves, so this wasn't a huge deal for me, but it was still cool.
service was great and we were checked up on often. if you check in on yelp you get a free conveyer belt item.

Let me tell you, I would give this place a 4.5 if I could. The only reason it's rounded down is bc the ambiance leaves something to be desired, they screwed up once on making our dine-in meal takeaway which led to a looooong wait for our food, and the once or twice where a dish may not have been 100% straight from the wok. Haven't had a terrible experience yet, and we've been here probably a dozen times by now, both for their dim sum and to take advantage of their bogo(!!!) lobster deal (available for dine-in after 6pm, FYI). The staff is starting to recognize us when we arrive!

For the price, this place is aMAZing! I recommend the dim sum and ginger-scallion lobster and their beef chow-fen. As with any authentic Chinese establishments with staff from China, don't expect Michelin-star service (but also, if you know someplace in Philly that provides that kind of service, please let me know so I can plan anniversaries and birthdays). However, they're attentive enough that I've only had to flag someone down once or twice for the bill. 

There's a reason that there's usually a line on the weekends for dim sum, and you'll find people of all ethnicities treated the same here. They try their best with everyone, and the only time I've seen people treated differently is when they've antagonized the staff first. I've come straight out of bed, and also when I've been gussied up for a big-date-type of Saturday. No one has treated me differently for looking like I might smell if you get too close. Maybe you're different, but I love that kind of indiscriminate treatment.

The bad: Mostly I just felt they were a bit pricier than a lot of their local rivals. This came through in the price of my Kung Pao Chicken order to begin with, but then I had to pay for an order of rice to accompany it separately. Considering more often than not places in Chinatown default their platters to come with rice, that felt like a bit of a slap in the face. I wouldn't have minded the slightly higher dish price much on its own, but having to order the rice separately drove it home a bit.

The good: The food was enjoyable. Their kung pao/gong bao came with a healthy amount of chicken, peanuts, and green peppers, as well as dried red chilis and pieces of spring onion for flavoring. I thought it could have been maybe a tad spicier, but it wasn't hurting for flavor. It wasn't so good that I'd say it's definitely my favorite in Chinatown/the city, but it's up there.

- Dimsum is made to order
- Soup buns (xiao long bao) could use more soup, but were not bad
- They give a fried pancake/dumpling/something complementary with a $25 or more purchase

Maybe some day they listen to chicken/beef eaters who refrain from pork like me. But that's a different conversation altogether.

This comes along with a bowl of rice, so if you plan to share wirh someone order another bowl orlf rice.

CoWorking spaces, dog parks, ""high-end"" thrift stores, plenty of coffee shops and the word ""fusion"" used more than I am comfortable.  In my experience this correlates to bad parking and high prices.  China Wok though, reminds me of simpler times.  Their decor including the faded, almost blurry posted picture menu, the red and green try-fold paper menus, and boy oh boy, daily Lunch Special pricing. I found this while driving back downtown from Ridge Avenue which has its own plethora of asian food spots - more Thai oriented than Chinese in my estimation. I noticed the yellowed sign and could see the plexiglass ""talking booth"" from outside. I knew I had to try it. 

Here is the order I placed on 10/11/19:

Lunch Special: 
(Comes with Roast Pork Fried Rice, Can Soda or Wonton Soup)
 
Shrimp Lo Mein
*Alt/Special request: Vegetable Fred rice

Sesame Chicken
*Alt/Special request: Fried hard, extra spicy, extra sesame; Vegetable Fred rice


Quoted Total: $13.50 
**Restaurant only accepts cash. 

I called it at 11:01 am. I remember hearing the chimes from a nearby Cathedral bell. The woman that answered was polite and not at all curt as sometimes is the case when you call during the lunch rush at some places. I asked for delivery (embarrassingly since this place is a ~10 minute walk from my house), gave my addy and ran down my special requests. She didn't immediately rush me off the phone and when I asked for the price she offered confidently.  Great! So far so good!

At 11:37 there was a knock on the door. Note: There was no preceding phone call. This is fine for me but those of you that can't hear the door from elsewhere in the house may want to consider this. I came to the door, pushed forth a $20, offered the tip and received my change. 

::I want to inject here that on a PREVIOUS ENCOUNTER with this driver there had been notable awkwardness when he didn't get a tip. I certainly appreciate tipping but it was definitely not fun being questioned about not offering one.::

I took my food into my office (see pics) and everything was made as I requested. In the bag, soy sauce, napkins, plastic forks. I didn't request any duck sauce, hot sauce or spicy mustard. I did not request chopsticks. The customary ""cookies not non-psychics."" No extra menus. I prefer reusable everything but this isn't the soapbox for my 60 second elevator pitch on climate change. I received crispy, not crunchy, Sesame Chicken with a dollop of sesame seeds. The chicken itself looked like chicken (heart-eyes). A diverse amount of vegetables were added to the usual humdrum broccoli bouquet. A thoughtful amount of shrimp was added to the Lo Mein. Nothing soggy or swimming in sauce/oil. Good portion size. I enjoy my lo mein cold so after taking a few bites I let it cool and then refrigerated it. 

Everything tasted fresh and was hot; steam rose from the lo mein when I removed the lid. The food wasn't heavy, or salty, or oily. The other reviews of this place are accurate. Getting the cash to patronize this place is far less annoying than receiving bad customer service and waiting two hours for inferior chinese food from other local establishments or the outrageous price of Ubereats and Postmates. 

That's it. No fireworks, no pitchforks.. Just expectations met, which in the days of Yelp and overpriced failed deliveries requiring heated exchanges with chatbots, ""expectations met"" is a revolutionary act - well worth a reading of the St. Crispins Day speech.

I was browsing on Yelp for restaurants close by and found this gem and made a reservation using the Yelp app. Upon entering, we were promptly seated on the 2nd floor. The ambience is really modern and sleek with their wooden decor and furniture, along with a slight oriental feeling as they had lanterns hanging from the ceiling. Makes for a great place for a dinner date.

My gf and I split two things on the menu: an appetizer and an entree. Beef and Tripe in Chili Oil is served cold and contains peanuts. It is a great way to prepare your taste buds for the spicy food you're about to conquer, hopefully. For the entree, we got the Spicy Aromatic Pot w Fish. This contained bunapi and wood ear mushrooms, onion, bamboo shoots, dry pepper, cauliflower, bell peppers, sesame, potato, and five spices all stir fried with your choice of protein. We were able to get these dishes less spicy, although it was still pretty spicy to make you sweat.

The only down side is that the service is a little on the slow side. It took us a while for us to place our order in with them and have our drinks served to us upon ordering.

Great flavor and cooked just right not chewy at all. The chili oil was legit top level spice

snow pea leaves, and the (5/5) 
Not too oily, perfectly salted and plentiful!

One less star because the noodles seemed to have been sitting for a bit so clumps we're stuck together which funny enough my husband likened to a folded up potato chip which he likes so he ate those. Flavor wise on point and again more than enough for two people.

OH MAN. This was the most expensive meal I have ever had. Granted, we ate 3.5 courses and each one was delicious. But that bill was a whammy.

We actually planned to go somewhere else for dinner because on this particular Saturday night, Saloon was all booked up at the time we wanted to eat and we couldn't make a reservation. Long story short, we ended up here anyway and it was only 15 minute wait for 2 people. We waited at the downstairs bar and got a round of drinks (wine for me, beer for boo). Lots of nostalgia in that area! It reminded me of my grandmoms house in the 80s with the knick knacks and such - and I mean that as a compliment!!

Our wait was truly about 15 minutes as promised, and then we went on a long walk up the stairs and around the corner to our table. I didn't realize how huge this place was inside so I guess that's why, even with no reservations, they could still seat us around 8pm on a Saturday within 15 minutes? There was going to be live music in the upstairs bar later so that might be worth checking out another time.

Our waitress came over to walk us through the menu and tell us about the specials. Pro tip: bring a notebook and pen because the specials menu is about the same length as the regular menu. She rattled off at least another 10-12 dishes ranging from salads to appetizers to entrees. She really knew her stuff because she did not fumble over a single ingredient. We thought we knew what we wanted from the regular menu by the time we sat down (clams casino, two entrees) but upon hearing the specials we completely changed course (punny!) and ordered almost our entire meal from specials.

We started with (special) salads, which we never do, because the ingredients sounded lovely. My partner had something like an apricot and pecan salad and I ordered a spinach salad wrapped in prosciutto with feta or something. I actually wanted the beet salad but she told us about that one by accident or they were out by the time I ordered. My salad was truly a wrap and in my opinion it could have used half the amount of spinach, but both were overall delicious and full of flavors and textures despite being rabbit food.

I lied, we actually started with the complimentary bread and what appeared to be a pesto dip. Nice way to cleanse the palate for sure!

Then we ordered the (special) appetizer that consisted of two clams casino, two clams some-other-way, two giant prawn boys, and two stuffed poblano peppers. We figured why settle for just the clams casino when we could try a sampler? It was yummy but I wish we had just gone for the casino because the entire appetizer ended up being something like $40-50 by itself and we mostly enjoyed the clams anyway. We were both a little creeped out by the prawns haha.

For our meals! I ordered scallops (another special) because I will never turn down scallops, and my partner ordered the only thing from our meal that was off the main menu - the veal parmigiana. When he ordered, the waitress asked what kind of pasta he would like on the side as if it was included but as it turns out the side of pasta was another $12. I could make an entire pound of pasta and sauce from scratch to feed a family of 4 for $12! *Shock* My scallops were delicious. I didn't like his veal but he enjoyed it. The pasta sauce was flavorful and yummy, always a good indicator for a solid Italian restaurant that doesn't skimp on the staples.

By this time I had seen a neighbor table order dessert and there was a huge tray of desserts brought to them and I heard ""cheesecake"" so I decided to get wild and top off my meal with some dessert. I ordered the pumpkin cheesecake. It was a perfectly textured/baked slice, but I didn't get a lot of pumpkin flavoring, and I am all about that basic b* fall PSL life so I was, admittedly, a little disappointed. Did it stop me from eating the entire thing? No. 

Then our bill came. We had tried estimating it along the way and knew it would be over $100 but we didn't expect it to be $195 (over $100 per person with tip)!

I left feeling quite satisfied, check shock aside. Everything we ate was delicious, albeit a little pricier than we anticipated. If we come back here I think we will limit ourselves to our normal 2 courses each and we will at least be aware that the specials are also especially priced and not always commiserate with similar-sounding standard-menu counterparts. It would be swell if the restaurant could print the specials so we know the prices and so the servers don't have to rattle them off for 20 minutes at the start of the meal. But, I had a similar experience at another Italian place (Giorgio on Pine) so I guess it's just an ambience thing to shout an entire new menu to me as a patron when I sit down. I can get with it.

He could make ZERO accommodations for us. There weren't even any sides that could be made. Cold noodles were the only other options so we stuck with the dan dan noodles.

Nan Zhou is pretty quick about getting people seated (if you have a small group). We recently visited this place during prime dinner time on a Friday night and they squeezed us in right away. The restaurant was pretty crowded. We tried the House Special Noodle Soup and the Signature Braised Beef Noodle Soup. You can either choose from hand pulled (thinner) or shaved noodles (thicker). I preferred the hand pulled noodles just because it's less hefty and easier to eat. The portions are huge and the toppings are plentiful. The Signature was very spicy, but satisfying. The House Special had a good variety of meats. The broth is very oily, so I tried to avoid sipping the broth and just ate the contents.

The portion was also just right so I was so satisfied when I finished my food. 

Another thing was great is that the restaurant could actually make gluten free changes to the menu items as I was at the restaurant with a friend who has celiac. So it was nice that she was also able to enjoy that. 

The loss of the star came from the service, while I had such a great time enjoying every bite of my noodles, i wish the man I had spoken to was more polite when we were asking about gluten free options.

Now for the food. They're fancy so they're doing the whole small portions but delicious food thing. AND they're nailing it... ordered the salmon toast and mushroom pizza.

The pizzas are normal sized so I'd recommend definitely getting a pizza and then the other things for tasting.

You usually see a wide variety of customers and it's always been busy when I went there. The staff are attentive and quick to tend to the tables. The food does take a while to be served so be hungry, but don't be starving.

The food was so delicious I came here twice with two different groups and they each loved it. 

The toothpick lamb was delicious for those that enjoy a slow burn that build up gradually. The lamb doesn't have the typical gamy taste which could also be due to the heavy cumin. So if you like cumin, it is the dish to go with. The cumin was powerful, but balanced with the spices making it flavorful and aromatic. The only thing i personally would change would be the toothpick part. It feels very arbitrary. 

The volcano chicken was good as well. The chicken was stir fried well so it wasn't dry and it had the right combination of flavor. The red onions brought a slight sweetness to the dish. Very well balanced dish, but it wasn't very spicy like the name might indicate.

The soup dumplings here are pretty good. It's not out of this world, but well made and flavorful. I would say these dumplings can easily contend with other very popular places in the city.

All in all, everything is very reasonably priced and the dishes come with rice as well. A great place to just get together and share a couple different dishes.

My wife and I came here because she has been craving pad Thai. 
After our visit she is still craving pad Thai. 
The portion sizes were huge but the taste was minimal.
The pad Thai was orange, it had no visible vegetables and herbs, and was sweet, not spicy as the menu indicates.
My wife did say the shrimp was cooked perfectly but that was the only positive thing she could say about the dish.

After 2 bites of the pad Thai my wife couldn't stomach anymore so we decided to speak to the waiter. We called for the waiter, literally, we had to call out across the restaurant because every time we needed something he was busy on his phone or watching Avengers on the TV. We expressed the problem to the waiter and asked if we could replace the meal with something different to which he agreed. After looking over the menu again my wife decided she didn't want anything more.

I had the beef with broccoli bento box lunch special. Aside from way too much brown sauce it was ok and a decent price.

We asked for the bill and the waiter brought out a takeaway box and the bill. Before I could say anything more he was gone again. When we finally got the waiter back I asked, ""why we were being charged for something we didn't eat?"" We were told ""because you ordered it. We have to just dump it."" To which I replied ""yes, but my wife did not eat it. It made her sick to the stomach. We should not have to pay for something we didn't eat."" I was then told he could charge half price but not take it off the bill. He said they would replace it with something different but that was all. By this point I was done with giving this place a chance so we ordered something different to takeaway. It wasn't something that I wanted but it was something rather than pay for a dish that made my wife sick.

Ambiance - 
This place is trendy / upscale - it's a dimly lit, nice restaurant that caters to the after-work and out with friends crowd equally, you will be equally appropriate in a suit and tie or your bar wear. While the restaurant is nice, I will point out that there always seems to be a long line for the bathrooms which I wish they would do something about - while this is par for the course for a bar/night-club it's not really conducive to a restaurant experience. It does get really crowded during Happy Hour. 

Food - 
Much like their sister concept Double Knot, Sampan encourages you to order several tapas-style dishes from their menu which the kitchen brings out to you slowly over the course of your meal. While not every dish was a smash hit, everything we had was pretty good - I highly recommend the Crab Wanton Tacos and the Kung Pao Chicken Wings. This place is better in a group as you'll get to order more dishes and try more of the menu. While we didn't have any dietary restrictions in our group, they made sure to ask at the start of the meal and offer both a gluten free and a vegetarian menu upon request. 

Drink - 
We enjoyed a few cocktails which were good, creative, and reasonably priced for the neighborhood. While I don't know much about Sake, they offer it by the bottle and offer a few different flights which sounds like a fun way to enjoy it. If you're with a group I recommend trying one of the Scorpion Bowls, it's a great deal and is a lot of fun, bringing me back to my fish bowl days. 

Service - 
Getting seated during Happy Hour was a lot less smooth than we would have liked. First of all, the host staff did not explain to us the difference between Dinner and Happy Hour until several prompts from us - the difference being the prices and deals available. Secondly, it took about 5 minutes for us to be seated as the host staff chatted among themselves and disappeared to the back, which would have been fine if we hadn't gotten to the dining room only to discover that it was nearly empty! Table service was good, our waitress was around just enough and was happy to make recommendations - she actually recommended our favorite dish which were the Kung Pao Chicken Wings. 

Value - 
The best value here are the Happy Hour Deals, however the seating for those are limited and they are not offered in the dining room, so it will be a little tough to plan for those. If you're anything like us, you'll go for the happy hour but end up paying full price because the bar area was overflowing with people.

Price-wise, the dim sum dishes will range from 2-3 times more than what you would pay at a traditional dim sum restaurant in Chinatown or NE Philly. My friend and I ordered their beef scallion pancakes, shrimp cheung fun, shrimp and chive dumplings, and pork and shrimp siu mai. Our server forewarned us that the beef for the beef scallion pancakes would be lukewarm. We didn't quite understand what he meant, so we nodded and agreed to continue the order. Sure enough, it was cold roast beef wrapped in a scallion pancake - we thought this was really odd, because the beef tasted like a cut you would use for pho, along with some pho fixins' and plum sauce in the beef scallion wrap. It was confusing, flavor-wise, and we felt that these tasted better before. The shrimp cheung fun tasted more like a thick rice noodle wrap, so it wasn't authentic. The shrimp and chive dumplings had an abundant filling, fairly crisp exterior, and decent flavor. The pork and shrimp siu mai were also large, in comparison to the typical size you would see at a dim sum restaurant, and my friend liked these the best.

This restaurant is a place everyone should check out. 

The atmosphere: The restaurant is huge. There were two main areas for patrons to eat, a bar, and private rooms along a hallway. The decor was chic and modern with many fantastic pieces of East Asian artwork. 

The food: I mostly had the dim sum and ordered the green beans so I will only comment on those. All I can say is wow. The variety of the dim sum cuisine was great! If you only have been exposed to one kind of dim sum restaurant and dishes, this place has you covered for taking your mouth on a culinary journey! Every morsel of food was hot, fresh and was able to carry its own despite the various dishes on my table. My absolute favorite was the pumpkin tart. You are given 4 adorable coquette style dishes and the red bean inside the soft yet crunchy pumpkin exterior was delicious! I would highly recommend them and the beef scallion pancake! Basically everything. Try the whole menu if you can!

The price: Since this place serves both dim sum dishes and regular dishes, you can cater your food according to how much you are willing to spend.

I still crave the broth and kimchi to this moment. Everything was fresh, flavorful and reasonably priced! My boyfriend is the pickiest eater of all time and loved Little Sheep. Unfortunately, they've become an All You Can Eat Buffet and the quality and freshness has dropped drastically. They've eliminated all appetizers from the menu, and cut down on the meats offered. Our half and half broth was brought out with a film of fat on it and tasted awful, it made everything taste like butter was added to the top. The buffet itself was extremely lackluster. Half empty containers down the line, seafood that smelled like it had been sitting - the shrimp tasted funky. The price is not unreasonable if you're content with a standing in line only to reach an empty container or fried rice that's under a heat lamp.

However, the two menu's contents differ, and even the price differs. The English for some reason has a lot more dishes than the Chinese menu. Moreover, for the items that exist on both the English and Chinese menu, a lot of them have different prices. We found a few dishes that were cheaper in the Chinese menu than when compared to the English menu.

Atmosphere was good. Very cozy. Dim lit and chill. Servers were quick and easy to communicate with. Prices were reasonable. Crowd was nice. 

Food size: portion was bigger than I expected. Lots of meat (at least for my dish...I ordered the Magic Beef noodles no fungus or mushrooms). The amount of noodles I got was great, it was really a lot, I couldn't even finish it.
We also ordered the crabmeat soup dumplings and it was okay, you get 6 dumplings for like $7-8 but I think Chinatown's dimsum garden might have that beat with the 8-9 juicy and very soupy dumplings they provide. 

Food taste: The noodles were soft and good. The bok choy was fresh and crunchy and tasted good. The meat was tender and had a good amount of fat and muscles that made it good. The only problem was the soup/broth, I think it was very bland. I tried to livin' the taste with the soy sauce and sriracha provided but I feel like that still wasn't enough do anything. 

My friend ordered the Mount Qi noodles(which is supposed to be spicy). From a glipse it was very colorful with the array of vegetables and tofu and I believe she had some beef in it as well. Although she complained that the broth was too sour, she appreciated that it wasn't too spicy. 

Funny thing was as we dined there, a fellow customer went up to pay for tab and offered his feedback. Yes, I eavesdropped. But anyways, I overheard him say the quality of the food ingredients itself (noodles, meat, and vegetables) were really good but his broth was too salty.

We got two small plates, a pasta, and a pizza. The hamachi crudo was amazing. The grapefruitand peppercorn made the dish so bright and the basil and pistachio give it such good texture. The fried octopus was also another good one with the pesto, white bean, and arugula.

The pizza. Was. So good. We got the Leslie chow, which had mushrooms, radicchio, taleggio, and Saba. The crust was so wonderfully bubbly and chewy. If you can't tell I'm a crust person, I am haha. The Saba gave it such a wonderful sweetness and paired wonderfully with the umami of the mushrooms and cheese. The radicchio then added a lovely bitter tone.

We had just taken these children to the circus and they were terribly hungry and feeling restless, ready to have dinner. Our group consisted of my wife and I, a two year old, a six year old, two eight year olds, and a ten year old. I mentioned their ages because the employee didn't accept or believe that our ten year old was actually ten. For some reason we had to prove that our growing ten year old as indeed ten years old and that we weren't trying to pull anything over this lady. As a quiz, she asked us what year she was born, hoping to catch us in some kind of lie. Upset by the question, we still answered honestly and was still turned down by her disbelief. Not only did we face her attempt to charge us an adult price for a ten year old, but she wanted us to pay for our 2 year old as well as if he was at least five. Fed up with this poor customer service, we chose to leave and not give them our business.

I worry that people will get deterred by the neon sign outside, thinking this is some average takeout. It's most certainly not. This is high-quality fish, high-quality rolls, and a variety/uniqueness that you won't find in a lot of places.

- The coconut water straight from the coconut. So good. Don't forget to eat the coconut insides after drinking the water. 

Things I didn't like about my experience:
- They forgot the drinks we ordered. Once we finally realized the tea and coconut was not coming, we had to remind them that we had more that we ordered.
- There were a couple things we asked for, like a spoon for the coconut, that took us reminding a couple waiters to get.

First off, you know the Chinese food here is legit because the owner here used to work in the Chinatown restaurant scene. Japanese food is not as legit in the sense that none of the sushi chefs here are Japanese, but the sushi is still fresh and at a more affordable price than nearby Yanako. 

There is also a full bar inside if you don't feel like eating and just want to hang with a couple drinks. Plus, happy hour food and drink specials don't hurt! 

The con to this place is the service. Our server didn't seem to know the menu too well, or just about Chinese/Japanese food in general.

I could get close to twice as much food for the same price over at Ting Wong, and the places in Chinatown that do cost more than Dim Sum Garden typically have MUCH better atmospheres (yes, I am willing to pay a premium to restaurants that don't stacked me like sardines in an awkwardly long, semi-claustrophobic restaurant layout).

2. But even if I'm not getting a crazy large portion size or a nice dining experience, all that could have been forgiven if the food blew me away, but this certainly did not. Maybe it's due to all the hype screwing up my expectations, but I found the soup dumplings very average. I've had thinner wrappers and more flavorful soup at my favorite places back home in Chicago. They did at least pass the ""better than frozen Trader Joe's soup dumplings"" test (it's embarrassing how many restaurants can't even manage that). Most everything we ordered was average, from the beef chow fun to the siu mai.

3. Tips: The best thing we got were the beef pot stickers, the filling was very dense and flavorful, not diluted with water or breadcrumbs (although if you're like my parents who prefer fluffy fillings, what I described might not be a good thing.) The worst thing we got were the scallion pancakes. Zero scallion taste, zero layers (yes, a good scallion pancake should have thin layers, it's not supposed to be heavy like a pita), and zero crisp, it might as well have been a steamed lump of dough.

4. Overall, I've gotten cheaper food at some places and better food at others (and a rare few that manage both) while attending school in Philly. If Dim Sum Garden is average all around and ridiculously crowded/overhyped to boot, I don't see any reason to come back",Dim Sum Garden,19107,"{'BikeParking': 'True', 'RestaurantsDelivery': 'True', 'Caters': 'True', 'RestaurantsTakeOut': 'True', 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': 'True', 'Alcohol': ""u'beer_and_wine'"", 'GoodForKids': 'True', 'WiFi': ""u'no'"", 'RestaurantsReservations': 'False', 'BusinessParking': ""{'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}"", 'RestaurantsAttire': ""'casual'"", 'HasTV': 'False', 'DogsAllowed': 'False', 'RestaurantsTableService': 'False', 'BYOB': 'False', 'HappyHour': 'False', 'OutdoorSeating': 'True', 'ByAppointmentOnly': 'False', 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'False', 'Ambience': ""{'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'classy': True, 'casual': True}"", 'GoodForMeal': ""{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': True, 'brunch': None, 'breakfast': False}"", 'Corkage': 'True', 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '2', 'WheelchairAccessible': 'True', 'NoiseLevel': ""u'average'""}","Chinese, Restaurants, Dim Sum, Asian Fusion, Shanghainese",0.1299659863945578,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Dim Sum Garden,19107,Center,0.1299659863945578,0.9095,0.1299659863945578

Even for a cash/venmo only restaurant, 20% is a little insane. A dish I paid $18 for on grubhub was only $15 on the menu, and the fish I got on Wednesday that cost me $16 at the restaurant is listed at $20 on grubhub! And that's not counting if you then pay for delivery and tip your delivery driver.

But anyway, on to the food. The first time I got sizzling Japanese tofu and shrimp off grubhub, it looked nothing like another reviewer's picture, the shrimp were tiny ""medium"" sized shrimp barely the size of a nickel (why grocery stores call those medium shrimp and then have to go up to large, extra large, and then jumbo, I'll never understand, marketing, I guess), there were some diced carrots and onions which were undercooked, and the entire dish was orange and tasted of, what I guess I'd call ""shrimp blood"". Now, my mom uses fresh head-on shrimp in her pork steamed buns  and it's great, but when she tried to do the same trying out a chiang fun recipe, it was an orange disaster. In a dish that's more mild such as tofu, using head-on shrimp is more disaster territory than a good idea, just stick with headless frozen shrimp please. Japanese tofu is always tasty though, no matter how bad you screw up the rest of the dish, so I still ate the whole thing.

But because TT Skewer and I are forever starcrossed (that's another story), I decided to give Bai Wei another chance, and I'm glad I did (and not just because I caught the grubhub thing). I got fish fillet in spicy sauce (水煮鱼 and the server had to verify I wanted the spicy dish and not literally boiled fish, which was topkek). And now, the only restaurant I've ever had this at served it with tofu and peanuts which is about as far from traditional as you can get, so my perception of this dish is way out of whack. Bai Wei does it more typically with cabbage and bean sprouts and it was equally good and I felt healthy getting some vegetables in.

The server did not stop by at all during my meal because I was all set with a gigantic pot of tea and it's typical in China to flag down waiters rather than wait for them to come to you (my parents HATE it when servers pop by to ask how we're doing), but within a few minutes of finishing eating and pulling out my phone, a server came by to ask if I was finished, so I assume they're relatively attentive and quick to respond, so just don't be shy you'll be fine at Bai Wei.

Also, on a recent visit, the Hotel entrance closest to the Restaurant was closed, I assume for renovations, and I had to enter from the main hotel entrance and walk around the lobby. Upon entering, the staff members were friendly, as always.  The decor is quite nice, with plenty of seating. It was crowded on a Friday night but we were still able to be seated, and they have bar seating in case it got even busier. 

Their Peking Duck roll appetizer is wonderful. I love the flavor of Peking Duck, but rarely want that as my entire appetizer. So this gives a little taste of that flavor, wrapped up in a pancake, and is just the right size.

Their Wonton soup is delicious as well. It is the more Authentic style (Smaller, round, wrinkled wontons rather than the big fat folded kind you see at cheaper take out places). 

I had the house special pan-fried noodles that were served with shrimp, chicken, and pork. The noodles were perfectly executed.  Crispy, but with just enough sauce to make them chewable, without being overbearing. the meats and shrimp were nicely done as well.  On previous visits, I have tried their Pho and other dishes.  Their Lo Mein is nice too, in that it's not the heavy fatter noodles one often sees. It looks like the same style as the pan-fried. They just are (presumably) boiled so they are not crispy.  

Pricing is higher than a typical Chinese restaurant, but so is the quality. I would not call this place a value restaurant. It is better than average quality, at higher than average pricing.  It is easier to drive and park here than it is to go to Chinatown. So I don't mind the premium pricing.

I've been looking for a go-to asian take out spot here in philly, and I think I might have found it! All of the food was absolutely amazing. The delivery price is a bit high. I wish they were on PostMates. 

Here's what I ordered: 

Egg drop soup: 10/10 -- perfect in my opinion. No frills. Classic egg drop soup. 

Pork Dumplings: 9/10 -- these are HUGE and delicious. The order comes with six and they are super filling. I might recommend ordering the ones in chili sauce. Although these were absolutely delicious, I did wind up dipping them in the sauce that came with my dan dan noodles. If EMei gave you three different sauces with these dumplings, it would be the PERFECT appetizer. 

Dan Dan Noodles (with beef)-- 10/10 super cheap and absolutely amazing. The noodles came separate from the sauce which turned out to be a great thing since we ordered way too much food. I wound up reheating the dan dan noodles the next day and they were still perfect.

Singapore Noodles -- 9/10. Delicious and a whopping portion. As Singapore noodles should, the dish was flavored with curry and served with bell peppers, onion, shrimp, beef, and chicken. The flavor was perfect, but I do think the bell peppers could have been cooked a little more. I also think the shrimp was frozen because they were all identical, slimy, and flavorless. Luckily the other flavors of the dish combatted the not so awesome shrimp.

The taste is great, but note that it's on the pricier side. 

Atmosphere: Very clean and new set-up with hotpot stoves. It's not your traditional hotpot where you add in your own ingredients into a steaming pot, however. They essentially continue to cook your entrees on a heated plate in the center of the table. Quite spacious, with interior seating of ~30-35 on the first floor.

Food: We ordered the steamed duck pot - the flavor was amazing, with a mix of leek and garlic. However, I thought the duck was a bit dry and didn't carry the flavor well. The particular entree we ordered also was 60% garlic, and not as much duck and vegetables as we would've liked - if there were more vegetables added, I would've enjoyed it more. For $30, you're better off ordering duck elsewhere in Chinatown, that can likely be just as flavorful (just not steamed in a pot). The Good Harvest menu offers a bunch of steamed / stir fried pot options, but they keep the Ocean Harmony menu downstairs too for other dishes (e.g., snow pea leaves, chicken w/ broccoli). 

Overall: 3.5/5 - an interesting new addition of stir fried & steamed pots to Ocean Harmony, but a bit too pricey for the amount of food you're getting.

We couldn't have asked for a more positive experience. From the beginning, Nick, our point of contact, was extremely communicative and accommodating in helping create a menu for the party. We initially shopped around different restaurants due to my fiancee being vegan. Nick and the rest of the team at Han Dynasty were so quick to craft a vegan menu that was not only the perfect amount for the 50 people who attended the party, but delicious and extremely affordable. And they were BY FAR the quickest to respond and friendliest. Every single person at the party, vegan or not, could not stop talking about how delicious the food was. Nick arrived with the food at the location of the party at the exact time he said he would and helped set up quickly and then emailed us the next day to check in and make sure everything went smoothly, and even congratulated us on our engagement.

We are extremely grateful for Nick and the rest of the team at Han Dynasty and will recommend them for any future party and event.

Loved eating here with my (Chinese immigrant) parents and my boyfriend :). There were lots of other Chinese families eating here on a busy Saturday night, which I always take as a good sign for a Chinese restaurant in America (speaking as a Twinkie ;)). Every table was occupied at 7:30 pm-8:30pm. We came in around 7 and waited 20-25 minutes to get a table for a table for 4. This restaurant was very clean.

This place is cash only/Venmo/Alipay. For a big and higher end Chinese restaurant, it's kind of annoying they don't take credit cards, but maybe this'll change in the future.

The service was excellent. The waiter refilled our Longjing Tea pot ($5) at least 3-4 times and the restaurant used high quality tea; despite the ongoing 20+ minute wait for tables after 7:30 pm, we never felt rushed during our meal and the service was quick when we received our food. 

This restaurant has excellent authentic/traditional tasting xiao long bao soup dumplings - I would argue they were as good tasting as the ones you find at Nan Xiang in Flushing NY! My boyfriend happily devoured the XLB. The pan-fried pork soup dumplings were great texture-wise (there's a bit of an extra ""crunch"" at the bottom of them), but only good/okay taste-wise (the meat filling is more savory-tasting than slightly sweet/salty like at some other Shanghai-cuisine restaurants - also, I didn't really taste much of the ""soup"" that was supposed to be in these (but the dough was a little thicker/heartier like in regular bao-zi, so maybe it just absorbed the soup). The vinegar/ginger that came with the XLB was great.

We also had a more traditional dish, pickled cabbage soup with tilapia ($28), that was fantastic! The soup came with a whole fish that was de-scaled. The broth had a rich, creamy texture with a deep flavor that clearly showed they used fresh, live fish in their soup and it was a huge portion for the 4 of us. This was my favorite dish in terms of flavor/depth and my Caucasian boyfriend (who can sometimes be hesitant/not-super-adventurous when it comes to Chinese food) was pleasantly surprised and even enjoyed this soup - he ate a huge portion of it.

The salt/pepper double delight fried squid & shrimp dish was also great - the batter was light and crunchy and not too heavy/oily, so I didn't feel like we were eating ourselves into a greasy food coma like some other restaurants that serve this dish. We also had the eggplant with garlic sauce and this dish was also made well - a little sweeter and not spicy enough for my own personal taste, but the texture of the eggplant was firm/cooked well and it was a good-sized portion for the 4 of us. Pretty reasonably priced meal for the 4 of us that came out to approximately $102 with tax & 18% tip with 1 tea pot, 2 XLB orders, 1 pan-fried XLB dish, 1 huge multi-portion fish soup, 1 veggie dish and 1 protein dish.

I would definitely come here again!

They did not offer any other item, we were charged 16.99 for this dish. We were ok paying for this, thinking, this was lesson learned and we would be more careful in learning beforehand how the food would be presented. 
Gratuity of 23% was added even before I could sign the receipt! When I asked why, I was told it's gratuity. I asked again, the manager then said, oh so you want to leave custom tip? I said, yes!

The manager then argued with me that I did not leave enough tip, I told him tip was not mandatory and I felt it was enough given the service.

My sister who lives in Philly says nothing but good things about Dim Sum Garden so my boyfriend and I decided to stop by while visiting from out of town. 

It was not the dining experience we had hoped for. Don't get me wrong the food is absolutely delicious (will get to that soon) but their service is lacking in all areas. 

Upon arrival, we had to wait INSIDE the restaurant for about 20-30 minutes. It is almost the year 2020 and they do not use a reservation or texting system that alerts you when your table is ready. If the owner doesn't want to take reservations..fine. But it is absolutely ridiculous to have customers form a line inside, while HOVERING around tables where customers are trying to enjoy a meal, all for waiting to be seated.
Fortunately, we were seated towards the back of the restaurant. I might have felt claustrophobic if I was sitting in the front. 

Service (2/5): Their service needs a lot of work. The whole establishment seemed to be disorganized as we were not assigned to one waiter throughout the night. Our food came out during random times and did not see a single person with a smile on their face. Also, when I placed another order of the soup dumplings the waiter seemed annoyed and said it would come out in 30 mins. Fast-foward to 15 minutes later and our dumpling came out at room temperature (not boiling hot like our first order). It was apparent that it was another party's dish that was served to us. 

Food (4/5): Food was delicious and filling! We ordered the Scallion Pancake, Shanghai Crabmeat and Pork Soup Dumpling, Shanghai Steamed Pork Soup Dumplings, and the Diced Chicken with Chili Pepper. My favorite was the crabmeat and pork soup dumplings and the chili pepper chicken. They were so delicious and full of flavor and spice. 

Overall, the price point is very affordable but comes at a cost with the poor service. Would I come back again? Only if it requires a zero minute wait time.",Dim Sum Garden,19107,"{'BikeParking': 'True', 'RestaurantsDelivery': 'True', 'Caters': 'True', 'RestaurantsTakeOut': 'True', 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': 'True', 'Alcohol': ""u'beer_and_wine'"", 'GoodForKids': 'True', 'WiFi': ""u'no'"", 'RestaurantsReservations': 'False', 'BusinessParking': ""{'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}"", 'RestaurantsAttire': ""'casual'"", 'HasTV': 'False', 'DogsAllowed': 'False', 'RestaurantsTableService': 'False', 'BYOB': 'False', 'HappyHour': 'False', 'OutdoorSeating': 'True', 'ByAppointmentOnly': 'False', 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'False', 'Ambience': ""{'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'classy': True, 'casual': True}"", 'GoodForMeal': ""{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': True, 'brunch': None, 'breakfast': False}"", 'Corkage': 'True', 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '2', 'WheelchairAccessible': 'True', 'NoiseLevel': ""u'average'""}","Chinese, Restaurants, Dim Sum, Asian Fusion, Shanghainese",0.09150793650793651,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Dim Sum Garden,19107,Center,0.09150793650793651,0.9753,0.09150793650793651

I got one skewer around 35 minutes after ordering, two more around 40 minutes after, and then the last skewer and my ""appetizer"" almost 50 minutes after I ordered! And this was around 8PM on a weeknight, the restaurant was not busy, but there was a table of four already seated and a couple takeout/delivery orders so it's not like they had to restart the grill for just me either. If you take out the grill start time, I've gotten faster food even from backyard barbecues! And I wouldn't have even minded a similar wait time if I'd gotten my appetizer first and then had all my skewers come out together, but no, food came out slow and completely haphazardly. On top of that, what sounded like, I don't know, rapid random morse code beeping was carrying over their speaker system, so it was all around a bad dine in experience.

The skewers might seem decently priced at a couple bucks but the portions are minuscule! The bacon wrapped enoki skewer amounted to one strip of bacon and less than a quarter of a package of mushrooms, which is probably something like 20 cents worth of ingredients. Yeah, I know restaurants have labor and rent costs, but come on, four measly rice sticks $1.50? Chuan Kee is the first restaurant where I've spent over $15 and left hungry, and that was with the sweet potato fries doing all the heavy lifting.

The food itself tasted okay (although they used the same sweet and spicy sauce on everything I ordered, so not much variety) except the lamb skewer, which was incredibly tough and gamey and one of the worst things I've ever had, which took what was an otherwise 2.5* meal down to a 1.",Chuan Kee Skewer,19107,"{'NoiseLevel': ""u'average'"", 'OutdoorSeating': 'False', 'HasTV': 'True', 'Caters': 'False', 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '2', 'DogsAllowed': 'False', 'GoodForMeal': ""{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': False, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}"", 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': 'True', 'BusinessParking': ""{'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}"", 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'RestaurantsTableService': 'True', 'RestaurantsReservations': 'False', 'RestaurantsDelivery': 'True', 'RestaurantsTakeOut': 'True', 'BusinessAcceptsBitcoin': 'False', 'WiFi': ""u'free'"", 'WheelchairAccessible': 'False', 'HappyHour': 'False', 'Alcohol': ""u'none'"", 'BikeParking': 'True', 'GoodForKids': 'True', 'Ambience': ""{u'divey': None, u'hipster': None, u'casual': True, u'touristy': None, u'trendy': True, u'intimate': None, u'romantic': None, u'classy': False, u'upscale': None}""}","Hot Pot, Chinese, Barbeque, Restaurants",-0.01970164609053499,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Chuan Kee Skewer,19107,Center,-0.01970164609053499,-0.5854,-0.01970164609053499

This was not the case at Nom Wah Tea Parlour. The understated, relaxed ambiance combined with good eats at reasonable prices were welcome surprises. 

I decided to try Nom Wah at a friend's recommendation and was not disappointed.

Most of the dining room was filled but it was not like you would have to be too close/right next to other diners. Some of you may think that because it wasn't super-crowded on a Saturday afternoon, it probably isn't good. And you would be missing out. Because the dishes were delicious. I ordered a lot of the usual suspects/favorites including all things shrimp - shrimp dumplings, shrimp rice noodle crepes, and pan fried shrimp and vegetable dumplings. I particularly enjoyed the shrimp and pea leaves dumplings dish, which is not as commonly offered in my home city (DC), as well as vegan options such as the scallion and cilantro rice noodle crepe and vegetable dumplings. My server was helpful and good about refilling the tea. 

As I was leaving, I noticed the sign outside that notes that Nom Wah was established in 1920. 100 years is no easy feat and I look forward to returning whenever I visit Philly again.

Note: My approach for my reviews is based on a combination of whether the food tasted delicious, the ambiance, service, and also what I expect for the area. I'm not from NYC, SF, LA, or Asia, but have experienced lovely food from all of those places, as well as bad dishes. The effect of awarding a local restaurant a lower rating solely because they cannot compare to restaurants in areas that have higher Asian/Asian descent populations can be more damaging to an otherwise good local business than we expect.",Nom Wah Philadelphia,19107,"{'RestaurantsReservations': 'True', 'DogsAllowed': 'False', 'WiFi': ""u'free'"", 'BusinessAcceptsBitcoin': 'False', 'HappyHour': 'True', 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'Caters': 'True', 'BikeParking': 'True', 'NoiseLevel': ""'average'"", 'GoodForDancing': 'False', 'Smoking': ""u'no'"", 'RestaurantsAttire': ""u'casual'"", 'RestaurantsDelivery': 'True', 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '2', 'Ambience': ""{'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'classy': True, 'casual': True}"", 'HasTV': 'True', 'ByAppointmentOnly': 'False', 'WheelchairAccessible': 'True', 'Alcohol': ""u'full_bar'"", 'GoodForKids': 'True', 'RestaurantsTableService': 'True', 'CoatCheck': 'True', 'OutdoorSeating': 'False', 'GoodForMeal': ""{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': False, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}"", 'RestaurantsTakeOut': 'None', 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': 'True', 'BusinessParking': ""{'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}""}","Desserts, Bars, Food, Coffee & Tea, Nightlife, Dim Sum, Restaurants, Cocktail Bars, Cantonese, Chinese",0.2770114942528736,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Nom Wah Philadelphia,19107,Center,0.2770114942528736,0.987,0.2770114942528736

The place is on the newer side, but the renovations were quick and only on the surface. Before I get into the food, I will point out how the place was near closing and the floors had already been recently mopped. I'm not really one to pick on something like this, but the layer of slime and grease on the floor was enough to level a sober human. 

Anyway, the place smelled great, the sauce station was next level, and evening everything LOOKED amazing. I can't say if the hot pot may have been better, but we did the BBQ. The price was reasonable--about $30 a person for more than one party could possible consume. But here is the rub: the orange glow of the grill itself was so deceiving. Our first grill seemed like it wouldn't cook our food if we sat there all day, so the waitress moved us to a different table. It was the SAME EXACT PROBLEM! The grill only appeared to be hot. 

On top of this lukewarm grill, we put everything from galbi to pork belly to  strip steak and rib eye. It just didn't really even cook. Then, the idea that raw chicken wings could even cook on a grill like this is preposterous. Plus, imagine having raw chicken touching all the other mostly cooked food on the grill. 

Needless to say, I consumed very little food, and left very hungry.

She said we had to walk to the store a little further down. Why would you display bubble tea of you don't have it there? It made absolutely no sense. We ordered our food and the waiter brought us lamb  instead of the beef we ordered and we didn't realize it. and my wife almost threw up. We aren't lamb eaters at all which is why we didn't order it. we ordered the tom yum soup base and the oxtail with tomato soup. It was very bland. The sauce bar was average at best. The meats just didn't taste as fresh or as good as other places we've been to. The music they played was more that you would hear if you went to a club not a hot pot place.

The more I come here though, my experience becomes a little worse every time; I'm not one to be too critical with service but it's the main complaint I have.

Pros:
- ambiance is great! nice decor, clean, has fun stuff like pool tables
- open late to 1am (used to be 2am)
- generally accommodating for large groups 
- food isn't bad tasting

Cons:
- the distance from the kitchen to the main dining area is probably a ~1min walk, more work for the servers and slower delivery
- I went to late night and they seemed to be generally understaffed for waiters and chefs
- The servers don't seem to have a system or tables they're in charge of? I always need to flag/wave down a waiter after waiting like 30 min to order
- Food in general is hit or miss with portion size/quality for price (soup dumplings have zero soup in them in the pic below :( )
- food is catered more towards ""americanized"" palette

None had a dedicated catering process, and this was too important to leave to chance. We hadn't been to Dim Sum Garden in a few years, but thought we'd try it. We were overjoyed with the quality and taste, and more to our delight, it had a catering operation. We were also able to order regular menu items not on the catering menu.
On a Monday we ordered the food, and it was delivered the following Friday. The food was warm, fresh and delicious.

I think it was $25.99 per person, same price for lunch and dinner. Lunch is 12-3 and they close for a couple hours until 5:30-10. Each table shares one pot and you can choose 2 flavors. Our table chose the half/half original and spicy broth. None of us thought the spicy broth was spicy.. at all! But you can choose extra spicy, so if I come back, I'd probably do that. I have to be honest and say I prefer the broths at nine ting better (along with the fact you get your own pot incase you feel weird sharing), but this was a good change. The spicy broth has spices I'm not too fond of like cardamom and cumin so keep that in mind. 

As far as meat, you use the card at the table that says ""I'm all good"" or ""I need help!"" to signal to the staff if you need to order more meat or a beverage. There are 5 kinds of meats you can choose from, 2 lamb choices, 2 beef choices, and pork belly. We had the aged lamb which was fine, it pretty much tasted like beef after being cooked in the broth. There's fatty beef which was my personal favorite and marinated garlic beef which I thought I'd like more than I actually did. The marinated garlic beef became weird in texture after being cooked, a bit too soft. Pork belly of course was good as well. 

There are also seafood options like crab, shrimp, and octopus where the ""buffet"" is. Plus fish balls--BEWARE!!!! the fishball with roe will explode when you bite it and the molten roe will severely burn your tongue (don't as me how I know...). Also tofu skins, any vegetable you like, and a small cooked section with UNEXPECTEDLY GOOD CHICKEN WINGS!! Seriously don't overlook em- they don't appear great but were so good. There's also a small but sufficient sauce bar if you need it.

***********************
As my friends and I put it as we were leaving, this is a restaurant that we would feel comfortable bringing our Chinese parents to/ the best Chinese/ Taiwanese food we have had without needing to order in Chinese.

I usually have different expectations of food authenticity and price efficiency for Chinese/ Taiwanese restaurants outside of a Chinatown or not a family-run business. However, I will say I was pleasantly surprised, so I applaud the owners for sticking true to their roots in DanDan's menu, cooking, and portion sizes.

The menu has dish names in both English and Chinese. For starters, we got the crispy spicy cucumbers, scallion pancakes, and wonton in chili oil. For entrees, we got the dan dan noodles, three cup chicken, dry spicy fish (unsure if that is the exact wording of the name on the menu), twice cooked pork (I think that is the English name for hui guo ruo 回鍋肉?) and garlic eggplant. Out food came with 2 medium-sized bowls of rice. The scallion pancakes were kind of small (only ten small pieces), but the eggplant portion size was pretty large. Again, I was pleasantly surprised by all the flavoring! Not that I'm by any means an expert on Chinese/ Taiwanese food and its authenticity, but this was definitely the most authentic food I've had in Philly outside of Chinatown, and for reasonable prices too.

The inside vibe is dark and ambient, great vibe for a date night or fun casual dinner with friends! It's a little small, so if you're coming with a bigger group, definitely call ahead. We were seated right away, but also I think we got lucky and there wasnt much foot traffic, from it being a rainy, cold night.

Overall, good Chinese food for good price, especially if you share everything with your group! My group of 7 went family style, and everything we ordered was enough for us to all feel full. However, if I wanted Chinese food, I'd still go to Chinatown for guaranteed good Chinese food in larger portion sizes and for less money.",Dan Dan,19102,"{'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': 'True', 'WiFi': ""u'no'"", 'RestaurantsReservations': 'True', 'ByAppointmentOnly': 'False', 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '2', 'GoodForMeal': ""{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': True, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}"", 'HasTV': 'False', 'BusinessParking': ""{'garage': True, 'street': True, 'validated': True, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}"", 'BikeParking': 'True', 'WheelchairAccessible': 'True', 'RestaurantsAttire': ""'casual'"", 'NoiseLevel': ""u'average'"", 'RestaurantsTakeOut': 'True', 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'Ambience': ""{'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': True, 'upscale': False, 'classy': True, 'casual': True}"", 'GoodForKids': 'True', 'OutdoorSeating': 'True', 'BusinessAcceptsBitcoin': 'False', 'RestaurantsTableService': 'True', 'Alcohol': ""u'full_bar'"", 'BYOB': 'False', 'RestaurantsDelivery': 'True', 'DogsAllowed': 'False', 'HappyHour': 'True', 'Caters': 'True'}","Taiwanese, Restaurants, Noodles, Szechuan, Chinese",0.12112573099415205,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Dan Dan,19102,Center,0.12112573099415205,0.9968,0.12112573099415205

The octopus was overfried and tasted a little burnt.  The mushrooms were excellent.

The messinessi was good but a little chef boyardee-ish.  Good thing I happen to like chef boyardee.

However the francobolli comes in a portion that is enough to feed a guinea pig, not a full grown human being - so be wary when ordering if you're hungry.  It is definitely appetizer sized (actually the appetizers were bigger).  What little was there happened to be delicious.

This is place is so freaking amazing. Very cozy, you can smell the aromas of the soup bases just right out of the restaurant. Next thing you know you're sitting down and downing the amazing broths. There are about 15 to 16 tables. The lights and the design of this place is on point. Such a modern yet comforting vibe.

Food: Now down to business...for appetizers we got the wagyu yukke and uni nagiri. Both just amazing. Uni nagiri is something to get when coming to this place. They place the dish under this smoke encased glass. So that the smokey-ness encases the sushi and uni. Just absolutely melts in your mouth. As for the wagyu yukke very interesting appetizer. Came out with a raw egg and minced wagyu accompanied by nori sheets. Very interesting but light as an appetizer should be. For entrees we got two soup bases, the original and hellish spicy pot. And boy should I tell you the hellish spicy pot is no joke. We got it at the lowest level of spicy-ness and it is no fricken joke. We got the hot pots accompanied with the wagyu combo platter, vegetable combo platter, purple yam noodles, green tea noodles, tripe, and Kobe Bimbap. The Kobe bimbap was so worth it. Very flavorful and they mix it in a stone bowl right in the table for you. The noodles are both worth getting as they're unique to the taste and powerful in flavor. 

Service: We were greeted by the handsome David ""Vee"". He was extremely polite and explained to us what hot pot was and how to eat hot pot. Extremely helpful and attentive. So thank you David ""Vee"".

The restaurant is in Chinatown on Arch St. Parking is a hit or miss; the areas in front of the restaurant and around the corner are always tough to find parking, but if you go a block over in front of the Convention Center/Reading Terminal, there are usually more parking spots (though can still be full). We were able to contact the restaurant ahead of time and place our name on the list, but we still had a short wait. Walking into the restaurant was quite amazing because you can smell the wonderful aromatics from the broths right away. You see the buffet and the vast amount of ingredients you cannot wait to put into your hot pot. 

After being seated, we choose the broths and the meats. I'm not really sure how this is ""Mongolian"" since it seems like a normal Asian/Chinese hot pot to me. Plus, most of the employees speak Chinese (some can ONLY speak Chinese, which is tough). We ended up doing the half-half, and the spicy broth was really amazing (lots of Sichuan peppers). and was very tasty It's pretty much all-you-can-eat, which is pretty awesome for any party size. The buffet consists mostly of the non-meat options (veggies, tofu, etc.), but includes seafood (ie fish balls) and some cooked foods (rice, fried dumplings, chicken wings). Trust me, you'll become full rather quickly. They don't have a bar, but it's BYOB and we brought a bottle of wine, which they provided wine glasses with no fee.

Usually when you walk past it, it's packed. The interior decor looks nice, very upscale. So my friends and I decided to come here for their birthday.

I am going to start off with the appetizer. The Baby Oyster Omelette was good. The omelette was nicely made and oysters were alright. Overall well seasoned and the soy based sauce accompanying it went well. It gave a slight sweet note to the dish.

For the entree I got the Sambal Sotong. This is a squid dish and I was intrigued. I love squid and spicy food is my jam. Despite how it looks, it isn't really spicy. The disappointment comes with squid. Personally, texture is a very important to me. Squid has a soft body, but there is still a resistance to them. Sadly, in whatever way this squid was cooked, it lost whatever texture it had. The squid was a soft as if I was eating tofu. Also these dishes doesn't come with rice and you had to pay a ridiculous amount for a small bowl of rice.

Overall, the experience didn't hold up to the appearance. Everything looked very pretty, but the flavors did not match with the aesthetics or the price. Having to pay for a bowl of rice for an entree dish is disappointing and even more so when the food isn't good enough to be eaten alone. Without the rice it would've been a soft mess. Maybe others would have luck with other dishes, but so far it was mediocre for all 8 of us at the table each a different dish.",Penang,19107,"{'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '2', 'BikeParking': 'True', 'GoodForKids': 'True', 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'Alcohol': ""u'beer_and_wine'"", 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': 'True', 'BYOBCorkage': ""'no'"", 'RestaurantsTakeOut': 'True', 'WiFi': ""u'free'"", 'NoiseLevel': ""u'average'"", 'HasTV': 'False', 'RestaurantsAttire': ""'casual'"", 'DogsAllowed': 'False', 'ByAppointmentOnly': 'False', 'GoodForMeal': ""{'dessert': False, 'latenight': None, 'lunch': None, 'dinner': True, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}"", 'RestaurantsTableService': 'True', 'RestaurantsReservations': 'True', 'WheelchairAccessible': 'True', 'Ambience': ""{u'divey': False, u'hipster': False, u'casual': True, u'touristy': None, u'trendy': None, u'intimate': False, u'romantic': False, u'classy': False, u'upscale': False}"", 'Caters': 'True', 'BusinessParking': ""{'garage': True, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}"", 'HappyHour': 'True', 'OutdoorSeating': 'False', 'RestaurantsDelivery': 'True', 'BusinessAcceptsBitcoin': 'True'}","Malaysian, Asian Fusion, Cambodian, Chinese, Restaurants, Thai",0.06546875000000002,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Penang,19107,Center,0.06546875000000002,0.4392,0.06546875000000002

Never had hot pot before, but the reviews were so compelling, we had to try. And we are adding our strong endorsement to all those that brought us here. The service was great - our server, Brandon, took time to explain everything and answer our questions, both at the outset and over the course of our meal.

We tried the Wagyu nigiri to start - OMG! It was phenomenal - the smoke-infused treat was overwhelming. 

My wife had the original broth and I had the Hellish. I tried a taste of my broth after it heated up - just a dip of a stick. WOW, that was spicy and I started to worry that the spice would overwhelm the cooked foods. Next, the beef combo. Three different cuts and each had a clearly distinctive flavor - and those flavors completely survived the Hellish broth. If you like spice, you don't have to worry about not appreciating the flavors of the cooked food. Next, fish balls and, again, incredibly flavorful.

We were still interested in trying more even though we'd consumed a pound of beef plus other items. So, a meatball sampler and orders of shrimp and scallops. You might think that these more subtle flavors would be overpowered by the well-used broths, but they weren't. The scallops were completely and wonderfully distinctive, as were the other items, but good scallops are so sweet and mild, I was amazed by how well they tasted.

Yes, pretty pricey, but we had a terrific, 2-hour meal and will absolutely be back.",Chubby Cattle,19107,"{'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'RestaurantsReservations': 'True', 'OutdoorSeating': 'False', 'RestaurantsAttire': ""u'casual'"", 'RestaurantsTakeOut': 'True', 'HappyHour': 'False', 'NoiseLevel': ""u'average'"", 'Ambience': ""{'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'classy': True, 'casual': False}"", 'WiFi': ""u'no'"", 'RestaurantsDelivery': 'True', 'RestaurantsTableService': 'True', 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': 'True', 'HasTV': 'False', 'BusinessParking': ""{'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}"", 'Caters': 'False', 'GoodForMeal': ""{'dessert': True, 'latenight': True, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': True, 'brunch': None, 'breakfast': None}"", 'WheelchairAccessible': 'True', 'DogsAllowed': 'False', 'GoodForKids': 'True', 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '2', 'BikeParking': 'True', 'Alcohol': ""u'beer_and_wine'""}","Restaurants, Bars, Seafood, Japanese, Hot Pot, Nightlife, Chinese, Conveyor Belt Sushi, Mongolian, Asian Fusion",0.27284946236559143,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Chubby Cattle,19107,Center,0.27284946236559143,0.9952,0.27284946236559143

We started off with the pancake and curry sauce and I have to say, that curry sauce was DELICIOUS. I wanted it on everything (I'll explain more later). It was creamy and peanut-y and the pancakes were crispy and not greasy at all. So good. I ordered the satay with tofu because I was looking forward to more delicious peanut sauce but that was not the case. When I think of satay, I think peanut, but this didn't really have much of a peanut flavor. It wasn't bad...it just didn't taste spicy and peanuty-y. The prices are good the service is good and the place is decent. Our bill would have been on the lower side for a meal in center-city on a Friday night if it were not for the bottle of sake that we ordered.

(I am personally on the fence between 2/3*.) Possibly because they offer bonuses/deals and require proof of a high rating on Yelp to enroll in their rewards program.

Let's start with the wait time.
We reserved a spot through Yelp which stated 2 hour wait. We arrive the time stated for the reservation only to be told it would be an additional 30 minute wait. After deciding to go to their bar/lounge located upstairs to wait it out we eventually get called down to experience a much worse wait of another 20-25 minutes. Making it worse because now we are standing in a small space having to endure the wonderful smells and seeing what appeared to be delicious foods.
The ambience of the place is pretty cool aside from the very loud music making it pretty impossible to hear the unintelligible speedy chat from the waitress. Also, there are two restrooms, one of which I believe was out of order while there 

Now for the average food, a couple things to be aware of and the terrible aftermath of the meal.

We went with a classic house broth and the lowest level of spice with a Spicy house broth. We only ordered a couple of seafood pieces and four vegetable options. Of which nothing to rave about. If going with seafood I would suggest the platter, as the portion size seemed adequate and the presentation looks wonderful with animal ice sculpture as the centerpiece. (We did try out the Wagyu brisket and it was phenomenal.)
We ordered green tea noodles that were tasty but the dish has a very small amount of noodles and if memory recalls the shobu that were decent.
Now on to the disappointing broths. The classic was very average and the spicy will most likely ruin your day. The two of us love spicy food but this is not enjoyable. Mixing the two had it bearable. I feel bad for the couple seated behind us who were unintentionally given the spiciest level and most likely could not consume after hearing his quote of ""this is literally the spiciest thing I have ever eaten!"" followed by other remarks. They should put some type of warning here.

A couple things to be aware of and keep in mind.
- If you are accustomed to endless servings that come with the all you can eat hot pot places...this is not it.
- When the assortment of garnishes are placed on the table be prepared to take what you intend on using, because they will shortly return to take it away.
- They do not have spoons. You will be drinking the broth from the bowl.

On to the aftermath. We left and took a short walk back to our place where I soon rushed into the bathroom where I found myself stuck for quite a long time. I do not want to go into too much detail here but I will say that if you are seeking a cleanse this would probably be the least enjoyable option to choose from!!

On a side note. It was appreciated that they offered two free dishes from a list they wrote out because of the long wait time. One of the choices being a salmon sushi roll that was tiny and bland.

If it was not for my company who happens to be the most amazing women in the world, knows how to make the best of a situation, and shared her beautiful smile through this experience... I would have been very disappointed, a bit upset, and partly offended by this NYE meal.

P.S. The cost was $75.00 (with a $15 bottle of Soju) and additional $25.00 for two cocktails and a shot while awating.",Chubby Cattle,19107,"{'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'RestaurantsReservations': 'True', 'OutdoorSeating': 'False', 'RestaurantsAttire': ""u'casual'"", 'RestaurantsTakeOut': 'True', 'HappyHour': 'False', 'NoiseLevel': ""u'average'"", 'Ambience': ""{'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'classy': True, 'casual': False}"", 'WiFi': ""u'no'"", 'RestaurantsDelivery': 'True', 'RestaurantsTableService': 'True', 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': 'True', 'HasTV': 'False', 'BusinessParking': ""{'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}"", 'Caters': 'False', 'GoodForMeal': ""{'dessert': True, 'latenight': True, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': True, 'brunch': None, 'breakfast': None}"", 'WheelchairAccessible': 'True', 'DogsAllowed': 'False', 'GoodForKids': 'True', 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '2', 'BikeParking': 'True', 'Alcohol': ""u'beer_and_wine'""}","Restaurants, Bars, Seafood, Japanese, Hot Pot, Nightlife, Chinese, Conveyor Belt Sushi, Mongolian, Asian Fusion",0.09889991181657846,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Chubby Cattle,19107,Center,0.09889991181657846,0.9103,0.09889991181657846

I'd had their basic steamed soup dumplings a time or two before and found them to be some of the best in the city, but over the weekend I sat down with a couple of friends and shared a slightly broader range of items at the bar. 

I wouldn't call our order ambitious by any means, but we had steamed soup dumplings, pan-fried soup dumplings, shrimp egg rolls, shrimp dumplings, and chicken on a stick. All of them connected. 

The two types of soup dumplings were the highlights and left my friends split on which they preferred; I was no help in deciding a favorite because I played it safe and said I prefer different ones on different days, which is absolutely true. They don't do anything out of the ordinary with their soup dumplings, they just deliver the goods the way they're supposed to taste. In China that's to be expected in my experience, but in Philly soup dumplings of both kinds are a more hit-and-miss affair (my girlfriend finds the fried ones to be as close to the ideal she formed on a trip to Shanghai with me a couple of years ago as any she's had in the States).

The shrimp dumplings they serve here are the delicate, partly translucent kind with big meaty shrimp pieces inside. They made a nice variation on dumplings from their soupy pork counterparts. Again, they're just classic shrimp dumplings done the way they're meant to be. I guess I won't go on much further because as I think about it, that's the kind of bland but sincere comment I have for most of the stuff we ate. The Spring Rolls with Shrimp were crisp and airy, but they were there and gone so fast, arriving as they did at peak feeding frenzy time, that I wish we'd at least doubled our order; they're only $5.80, so I'm not going to complain about the price, but do be warned - it's a small order. The chicken on a stick (which is closer to SE Asian satay than the Chinese meat skewers from my time over there) was a more substantial order (four sticks) at a similar price, but they also left the least impression on me. Then again, I let my friends have a larger portion of those in favor of getting an extra fried soup dumpling, so maybe that factors in.

There's still plenty I want to try here. In terms of dim sum, I expect good things from the spicy soup dumplings, pumpkin cakes, and fried beef dumplings. But I now really want to try their more standard, full-plate dishes because they've proven that they do dim sum well enough to excite me for their Kung Pao, eggplant, hot pots, etc.

We went down to Chima today for restaurant week. We opted for the $50 menu which included better meats and dessert. Well by the end, we checked the menu and saw that they did not bring out the meats that were included in the $50 menu besides the lamb chops but some of us didn't even get a chance to get some because they ran out and were suppose to come back and So we told the waitress and she Wanted to bring out the items we did not receive but it was too late at this point we were done. 

So the manager MAURO comes over being all pissy and stuck up  and says to us, "" maybe you missed it and were to distracted "" !!!!!! Excuse me?! Our group of 15 people missed the meats?!? 

Then he goes, ""maybe you didn't know that it was filet""

First of all how dare you insult us by not knowing what filet is or how it looks or taste! And second there was nothing bacon wrapped that came out and he processed to LIE and say that they don't serve that anymore!!!! 

Well when I stepped out and came back to my table I saw the guy carrying the filet with bacon!!! And we told MAURO to check the cameras but we knew he knew and was being a complete prick

So he's like what do you want me to do.. ah adjust the pricing to $35 since that's that meats we got. Because we got chicken and that was only on the $35 menu. 

Well he DID NOT WANT TO ADJUST!! But instead wanted to give us $25 gift cards!! Like we want to come back after this?!?

So We disagrees and said no we don't want your cards but we want the adjustment and he proceeds to say well are you having dessert and we said you don't have to bring us dessert and we will take the35$ menu price. Well seemed like he agrees and leaves. 
Next thing you know, they brought out dessert and without having the head person who was dealing with this manager know, some of the party of 15 started to eat it! 

What a manipulative person!!

Had dinner here tonight with a large group. We were given an option to do the regular menu for $50 or the restaurant week menu for $35. The restaurant week menu had a limited amnt of meats and did not include dessert so we opted for the $50 menu. Towards the end I look at the menu and realize that we were never served half of the meats from the $50 menu - no filet, no bacon wrapped filet, no ribs!  We proceed to mention to waitress and she says that she can speak to the chef and they can bring those meats out. At this point we are all stuffed and pretty much ready to leave. So, we proceed to tell her that we don't want anymore meat, but think it makes sense to do some type of discount since all the meats never made it to our table. She makes a comment about the fact that we didn't mention it earlier so we kindly explain that we didn't even realize until looking at the menu again. She says she can talk to the manager. The manager states that he spoke with the staff and they confirmed that they brought all the meats and that our party of 15 is basically lying. He proceeds to say that we were probably ""distracted"" and didn't see when the meats were being served at our table. He also accuses us of not knowing what filet looks like and says that they are not serving the bacon wrapped filet anymore. When I get back to the table  after talking with Manager Mauro we see the guys walking around with bacon wrapped filet!
After a few minutes he comes over and says ""What do you want me to do?"" Ummm, you're the manager.... figure it out!!!! He brings over $25 gift cards and says we can use them next time. We decline and say that we would rather see a discount tonight because we don't know if we'll be back. He asks if we ordered desserts and we say that you can cancel the desserts and just discount our check, which he seems to agree to and leaves. 
Manager Mauro never returns! The waiter brings out some of the desserts and we get charged the 50$ pp price, plus  $$$ for sparkling water and coffee and tax and tips.... so the $35 buffet ends up costing us almost $80 pp! 
I usually don't write reviews and never complain and I've been to Chima multiple times, but I will not be back again. I felt cheated and ripped off and the worst was the Manager accusing our party of 15 of not noticing the meats and not knowing what they look like!

Came here on a Saturday night with family being seeing a comedy show around the corner. There was a wait and unfortunately due to the small capacity of the restaurants front end you have to wait outside which isn't ideal when it's cold, but the wait was too long. 

After being seated we were greeted and given tea. The menu is pretty expansive and offers many many items to choose. I ended up ordering the Beef Noddle Soup and the Garlic Chicken and Eggplant.

They will hold your reservation for 15 minutes, and if your entire party is not there, your reservation will be cancelled and you get put on the waitlist. This happened to us, but our wait was less than 5 minutes, once everyone arrived. They offer valet for $11 plus tip, but the parking garage around the corner (although it can be tough to navigate through) was only $12.

They offer both a full menu with all the meats, sides, and a dessert, and a restaurant week menu with select meats and no dessert. They warned that if they saw meat sharing they would charge both for the full menu price. There's a salad bar with some greens, bread, soup, cheese, deli meats, etc. I would go easy on these items but would recommend grabbing a couple of these just to have a break from all the meat. 

If you're like me and don't really care too much about what kind of meat you eat, I'd recommend saving the extra money and getting the restaurant week menu. I wouldn't think of going here during anytime but restaurant week. You still get a great selection and great experience! (And after a while, I can't even distinguish what cut I'm eating lol)

The staff and service were amazing. Our side dishes and drinks were constantly being refilled. They'd offer us new plates and asked us we had any requests for particular meat selections. When we'd leave the table, they'd pick up our napkins and refold them. If there were scrapes of food on the table, they cleaned it up. 

As far as the sides that come with the meal, I absolutely love their mashed potatoes. I easily ate 5 bowls. It's a great compliment to the meat, but can also be enjoyed alone.

Why, I don't know, but part of being a friend is acquiescing to requests like this, so I met him at 9th and Arch and we proceeded to do as he wished-walk around. Of course, all this perambulation makes a man thirsty as well as hungry. David's Mai Lai Wah, which I heretofore knew nothing about, was right across the street when we both commented on our growling bellies, so we stepped inside. 

When we entered, the place was empty save for 2 tables and even then, we stood in the entry way for more than 10 minutes until someone acknowledged us and pointed to a table. We sat, were given menus, then we sat some more. 

The cocktail menu is odd to say the least, with things on it like 'Bee Feater' and 'AB Solute.' Quirky spelling aside, a lot of classic cocktails are priced at $6.50 here, which is about half of what you'd usually pay in almost any Philly bar.  We wanted some booze, we were ready to eat. Still we sat. 

Finally a curt older waiter came and asked what we wanted to drink. I ordered a Manhattan and Tim asked for a martini. We were not asked what kind of liquor we wanted nor did the waiter pay any attention when we said we were ready to order food. Hmmm....

Another 20 minutes passed, the place was still only 2 tables full plus us, and no drinks nor anyone inquiring as to what we wanted to eat. 

At last our drinks came but again, when I said (politely) we wanted to order food, I was ignored.

The drinks. Oh, those drinks. Tim took a big swig of his martini and started to cough. I teased him about being a light weight until he made me taste his cocktail. I sipped and looked at him with raised eyebrows. ""I know. Right?!,"" he said. ""This must be some kind of industrial cleaner, not booze. It will probably kill us."" With trepidation, I tasted my Manhattan and got a mouthful of what tasted like very cold cherry Robitussin. Since I'd done the honors for Tim, I made him taste my drink. Even through all his Botox, he screwed up his face when it hit his taste buds. I suggested we ask for the check and go elsewhere for food, since we knew we would not finish these abominable drinks and felt certain that no one was going to take our dinner order. 

We tried catching the eye of several servers to no avail and finally Tim went to the register with cash, saying we wanted to pay. By now, the front of the restaurant was clogged with people waiting to be seated. The woman at the counter looked through Tim and did not take his money. He pressed a male server into helping him and was told that this server did not know what he had. Tim named the drinks and the man walked away.

He sat down again, suggested we just leave money on the table and go and said he needed the Gents before we headed out. While Tim was performing his ablutions, I again tried to get someone to give us a check and held up both credit card and cash as I attempted to get someone's attention. No dice.

Tim came back a little pale and I asked if he had a bad bathroom experience. He said the toilet was dirty but what bothered him were the dead fish floating in the over crowded, dirty seafood tank in the back, being eaten by live fish. 

At that point, we put 2 tens on the table and pretty much fought our way through the throng of people at the door who were still not seated. I wanted to shout out, 'Abandon hope, all ye who enter here,' but felt that would just be in bad taste.

Steamed pork spare ribs - honestly, you can't mess dim sum spare ribs up. Ranking this the highest because I'm biased and I love meat more than carbs.

Rice roll with fried dough - This one is carbs-overload (my friend loves rice rolls). It's more of a sweet than savory dish, as it comes drizzled with a sweet soy sauce. 

Cilantro and scallion rice roll - More rice rolls. I personally would've preferred the shrimp rice roll, but this one was also good. The rice paper itself was thick and soft. 

Steamed Chinese broccoli - Not even a dim sum dish. We just wanted to pretend to be healthy lol. 

Xiaolongbao - The above dishes were all standard dim sum quality, but I genuinely didn't enjoy eating the xiaolongbao. When it came out, we could already tell that the skin was way too dry, so they were probably standing out way too long. As a result, it was hard to peel the dumplings off the steamer, so a lot of the juice spilled out. Overall, the meat wasn't as flavorful as we would've liked.

Parking is minimal, street parking mostly. I would walk if you can. 

Lots of choices, variety of proteins. Definitely need to come back multiple times to try different things. We got the garlic sauce with chicken which I was not a fan of but portion sizes were good. Meant to be shared/family style. Also got the salt and pepper shrimp which was to die for but like most places it was a tiny portion. We killed this dish and wanted more! Not overly salted which is always good. Finally the wonton soup was a light refreshing soup. May have  added a bit too much black pepper as out daughter was not able to eat the actual soup but she enjoyed the wontons.

Overall, definitely wil  be back to try more of their dishes. We did get dessert too, their Mochi which comes from a prepackaged  place so it was standard nothing to rave about.

Food: 3, Value: 3, Service: 4, Atmosphere: 4.5

I'm from a Cantonese family so I always try to find great Cantonese food wherever I go. We decided to  try this place on our weekend trip to Philly. The atmosphere is nicer than most traditional Cantonese places and service was quick, however our server was not familiar with the menu and did not understand the Cantonese names of the dim sum when I tried to order. Overall everything we ordered was just average. Here is my specific thoughts of the food:

Ho Fun - decently done, but did not have much flavor. Not enough meat. Had to add quite a bit of soy sauce to get adequate taste

Pork belly with mustard greens - very thin slices of pork belly and small portions. Don't be fooled, underneath the pork belly is a pile of mustard greens not pork. The buns are soft, but did not seem home made.

Dim Sum - just average. Tried a few different things. The noodles and wrapping were a little thick and the meat filling lacked flavor.

We got seats for four right away on a Wednesday night. We ordered a variety of things.... they were offering a special ""BOGO"" for certain meats, and we chose two portions of the pork belly as well as the wagyu variety platter with three kinds of beef.

I also chose the miso broth base. A vegetarian from our group got the mushroom. One variety vegetable platter was plenty for the four of us. 

The broth unfortunately took about ten minutes to boil. So as our various items came out for us we began to lose table space. They brought over a small metal table to help, which it did a lot. 

Once we were cooking it was great. Our server told us how long to cook each item that came out.

There was no wait when we arrived, but Chubby Cattle has the wait list available via Yelp which is fantastic. We all ordered different broths, my girlfriend ordering the Miso Tonkatsu (definitely recommended - super delicious, dense, and my favorite of the ones I tried), and I ordered the house which had a decent taste but did lack a big punch in flavor.

They bring a caddie out with all different ""toppings"" like garlic, scallion, etc., to make your own dipping sauce for the meats. We ordered the brisket, the waygu sampler, soup dumplings, and the vegetable sampler. The meat was all delicious, beautifully displayed, and tender. The vegetables kind of lacked variety in the sample and were mostly large, leafy greens that didn't break down well when cooked. The soup dumplings came out frozen and were colorful, apparently each color representing a different flavor that the dough was made of, although they didn't taste too different from one another.

Five stars for the service, which was the best part of our experience. I liked the more upscale hotpot experience, but is it that much better than Little Sheep?? Not for the price point. The wagyu foie gras was a bit gimmicky for $18. It was flame torched just before serving, which made it difficult to taste the actual flavor of the beef. If I'm paying for sashimi style meat, why add smoky flavors? The tiger shrimp and mussels also did not look fresh at all, maybe they were leftover from Chinese New Year?

My friend lives nearby and really likes this place, and she's absolutely right. The food is solid--spicy, authentic, and decently authentic. We got the dan dan noodles, wontons in chili oil, pork belly with sweet garlic chili oil, and spicy beef hand-ripped noodles. Everything was wonderful, but our personal favorites were the dan dan noodles (my husband still thinks about this) and the spicy beef hand-ripped noodles, which had the most tender morsels of beef and delicate noodles. I can see either one making a deeply satisfying meal for one. We're moderate chili lovers and thought the food had a pleasant amount of heat, but if you live for the burn, you might want to ask them to make it spicier. 

The restaurant is trendy with a nice romantic ambience if that's what you're into. Prices are reasonable for the area, and portions are large. The three of us split 2 apps and 2 noodle dishes, which was plenty of food and the total only came to around $40 before tax and tip.

We were not disappointed.  Positively or Negatively, this is best experienced with more than one person and table space is at a premium, but we enjoyed our experience and will be back!

Before I get into my pros/cons, a little bit of a primer for the uninitiated (which was us until last night).  Hot pot, or hotpot, also known as steamboat, is a Chinese cooking method, prepared with a simmering pot of soup stock at the dining table, containing a variety of East Asian foodstuffs and ingredients. (Per Wikipedia).  

We began by ordering out hot pot base, which include a number of broth options.  Previous yelpers warned for extremely spicy options, so we opted for the house and beautiful tomato soups - they were both delicious broths and both my wife and I found the house broth to be a flavorful experience - especially with the dumplings and noodles!

They bring out the soups, instruct you on how to heat them (""have you dined with us before?"") in a very non-judgmental way and then you are left to order any number of items to dunk and cook in your broths once they boil.  Food items are delivered a la carte with cooking instructions (times) and some items can just be left in the broth for minutes while you eagerly engage in others.  We found the experience fun and delicious, although we found presentation often got in the way of simply placing lots of food items at the table.  Overall, it was more an experience than just a meal!

Pros:

The star of the show was the beef.  Beautifully marbled Wagyu beef not only stars on the menu, but is advertised/displayed throughout the restaurant.  And with good reason, it's truly a decadent and delicious experience, with a well-distributed fat content that basically balances the fat content in an ideal manner.  Basically, the Japanese have mastered beef and it's served in bit size hot pot cooked slices for you to enjoy.  We tried the Wagyu Brisket and Rib-eye and we not disappointed.  We enjoyed the Rib-Eye slightly more as it was a more sustainable bite, but both were excellent.

The housemade flour items were delicious.  Our server recommended the green tea noodles and we also tried the dumplings which were both freshly made and flavorful.  The dumplings in particular were a beautiful rainbow of colored doughs that included some very fresh raw meat which required a 10 minute cook time.

Additionally, the seafood combo we tried was both beautiful and plentiful, including fine easily cooked lobster, shrimp and slices of various white fish.   Well worth the price of admission and not a disappointment.  

Another excellent experience was the sauce making - you begin by making a sauce to enjoy your various options - featuring any number of delicious accouterments.  But decide quickly as it needs to be removed from the table somewhat fast.  We found the fried tofu was the ideal vehicle (it's tofu, so of course) for consuming and tasting the sauce as we altered it.  

Finally, our server Angel was truly excellent - one of the best service experiences I've ever had.  He was fast, attentive, experienced and knowledgeable of the menu.  He was capable of explaining all of what we were trying, what was worth the experience and making other recommendations.  

Cons:

It's certainly pricey.  The menu is essentially a la carte and best enjoyed in a group setting to try a number of items.  Most ""dishes"" come with many pieces for a table of 2-5 to enjoy several of and it's clearly constructed as such.  For the price, the quality was high, which seems to be the theme of Chubby Cattle

Is this a con?  Things are served very quickly and we ran out of room fast!  

The beer list was far from extensive (some standard Asian beers along with Heineken and Corona) and they did not have any Soju which was a little disappointing.   If they've got a liquor license, they may wish to up there game.

Perhaps we ordered poorly, but our vegetables were lackluster and I wouldn't spend too much time on that part of the menu.  I actually found the veggies in the broth to be far more enjoyable.

Conclusion:  Our first Hot Pot experience was a truly positive and enjoyable one.  With individual pots, a large and expansive menu with a wait staff that is extremely knowledgeable, we were not disappointed.

Anyways, my 3 stars are solely because the customer service is horrible I thought at first it was a cultural thing you know, the strictness and short flat temperament of the staff but now I just think they're mean. One time in 2019 they were closed for a while and I felt like every time I went for food they were closed so once I caught them open and went in I attempted to have small talk with a waiter asking ""hey you guys have been closed for a while what happened?"" And I was bluntly told ""you have break right?!"" So rude in my opinion I was excited to be a patron again just to be put in my place I guess you can say. We are nothing more than cash flow to them and I feel bad saying this because I'll continue to be a customer because of that salt and pepper recipe  So for the maybe more sensitive folk who want to feel valued where they spend money BEWARE the chances of a friendly interaction are little to none staff wise.

Always great to find a vegan chinese food place!

The rice was yummy and the other 'meat' pieces and sauce was very very good. Oh the miso soup was decent too.

I ordered three dishes: the dungeness crab over sticky rice, the taro and duck casserole, and the frog congee.  This was my first time having dungeness crab and frog, so I was really excited for how they were going to taste.

I will say right off the bat, be prepared for high market prices of the seafood here - the dungeness crab was $58 and we also inquired about a few other seafood dishes at market price and found them all to be pretty eye-watering. My partner and I were given restaurant credit in exchange for a review of the restaurant, and so if it were not for that, we may not have tried it. I'm so glad we did however though - the crab on top of the perfectly cooked sticky rice was such a treat. 

I'm originally a Marylander, so I do have a bit of bias for cooking crabs smothered in Old Bay, and I do honestly believe the dungeness could have used some salt and seasoning.  If I were eating it without the sticky rice, I would have probably liked it less but regardless, it was still steamed to perfection and delicious. The duck and taro casserole was not what I expected at all - it was stewed in a kind of savory gravy but it was good overall and great with our white rice we were given with it.

The frog congee was also great - frog tastes more or less like stringy chicken, but the huge vat of congee was very much welcome on this super cold night. We took plenty of leftovers home and were really satisfied with our meal. Service was super attentive, and every time our side plates got a little bit dirty, servers were there to whisk them away for new clean ones.  The restaurant was pretty empty, and we came on a Thursday night.  It seems though that they can accommodate very large parties easily, and I would definitely bring more people here to try more of their dishes (especially the plentiful hot casserole pot options they have).",Good Harvest 大丰收,19107,"{'GoodForMeal': ""{'dessert': None, 'latenight': None, 'lunch': None, 'dinner': True, 'brunch': None, 'breakfast': None}"", 'Alcohol': ""u'beer_and_wine'"", 'RestaurantsTakeOut': 'True', 'BikeParking': 'True', 'BusinessParking': ""{'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}"", 'Caters': 'True', 'HasTV': 'True', 'OutdoorSeating': 'False', 'DogsAllowed': 'False', 'Ambience': ""{u'divey': None, u'hipster': False, u'casual': True, u'touristy': None, u'trendy': True, u'intimate': False, u'romantic': False, u'classy': False, u'upscale': True}"", 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': 'True', 'RestaurantsTableService': 'True', 'WheelchairAccessible': 'True', 'HappyHour': 'False', 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '2', 'WiFi': ""u'free'"", 'RestaurantsReservations': 'True', 'BusinessAcceptsBitcoin': 'False', 'RestaurantsDelivery': 'None', 'BYOB': 'True', 'NoiseLevel': ""u'average'"", 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True'}","Cantonese, Seafood, Chinese, Restaurants",0.27323552233929604,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Good Harvest 大丰收,19107,Center,0.27323552233929604,0.9979,0.27323552233929604

FYI - Ninja Bao is underground in the Septa station, just a few stores adjacent to the Dunkin Donut.

Must get: chicken katsu bwa bun, free gyoza
Meh: roast pork bun, pork ramen
Missed out: dessert bao

As a native-born northern Chinese, I am very particular with baozi, or steamed buns stuffed with vegetables or meats. So you can imagine that my simultaneous hesitance and excitement when I heard about the new baozi shop. In short, it's fun, fairly well priced, salty and sweet. Unlike traditional baozi, ninja bao are steamed in similar manner, but also fried at the bottom to get that crispy bottom. While I was not too crazy about this cooking style, I was very surprised by how hot the bao remained, even after a long period of wait time while digging into other dishes. As for the actual inner content, the roast pork bun is very similar to the cha siu bao (or the sweet and savory, aka barbecue pork bun) that you can find at dim sums, however, given that I don't like bbq pork buns...it wasn't my favorite by default. The chicken and corn bao was actually quite a pleasant surprise as chicken is uncommonly utilized in Chinese steamed dishes (dumplings or baozi), but I found the overall combination of the ingredients to be a sweet and salty delight.

The bwa bun, or one-sided bun, is beautifully packaged and definitely the star of the restaurant. Of the options, the best is definitely the chicken katsu, as the chicken is incredibly juicy but crunchy and worked best with rest of the fillings. That being said, I think these buns utilize too much sugar (visible layers of crystalized sugar on the bases) and thousand island dressing that definitely reminds you that you're eating something non-traditional. My biggest disappointment is the roast pork, which was way too fatty. In fact, for the pork bun and pork ramen, we had to throw it away because it was too fat to eat and enjoy. While the fatty pork made the broth of the ramen reach greater heights, I was highly disappointed when I had to throw away the generous chunks of meat away.

Overall, this was a fun and unique establishment to visit, especially if you're traveling via Septa. The service is very friendly, almost too friendly, and you get a free gyoza on arrival, so it's definitely worth a visit.

They offer a good rendition of modern Chinese fare, centered on skillets and dry pots. It didn't completely blow me away but was skillfully executed.

Our first impression on walking in was that we'd walked into a mid-market restaurant in a well-off part of Beijing. They nailed the currently-fashionable modernist decor common in restaurants in China to a tee. Service was fast and responsive, though it seems their marketing consultant didn't make sure instructions were left for frontline staff on how to handle this promotional offer, which took a minute to sort out.

We ordered a yellow-braised chicken pot and a ying-yang pot split between flounder and blue crab.

The former is a style of cooking common in Northern China; chicken and vegetables are braised with spices and then splashed with water, covered, and left to steam for a while. Theirs was spot-on; not as heavily salted as some others but that's all to the good. It's not the best we've ever had but it is the best we've seen locally.

The seafood pot was less impressive; it was good, just not amazingly authentic or breathtakingly innovative. China has a way of cooking white fish such that it comes out awesomely tender and juicy, which they nailed, but it was a bit blander than we expected, perhaps because we didn't specify a spice level.

The crab was also good; chunked up, lightly breaded, and deep fried in the Chinese style. The upshot is that it's possible to eat the softer bits of shell when it's done this way; the underside of the carapace and the thicker parts of the legs are edible.

Their naan/flatbreads were a perfect rendition of China's imitation of the original Indian; my wife loves banana flatbread so she was overjoyed and ate the whole thing.

We didn't pay much attention to prices but they seemed reasonable from what I recall.

Overall, we were happy with it; Good Harvest is good enough that it would survive in the cutthroat mid-market segment in China, so it certainly deserves to here in Philly.",Good Harvest 大丰收,19107,"{'GoodForMeal': ""{'dessert': None, 'latenight': None, 'lunch': None, 'dinner': True, 'brunch': None, 'breakfast': None}"", 'Alcohol': ""u'beer_and_wine'"", 'RestaurantsTakeOut': 'True', 'BikeParking': 'True', 'BusinessParking': ""{'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}"", 'Caters': 'True', 'HasTV': 'True', 'OutdoorSeating': 'False', 'DogsAllowed': 'False', 'Ambience': ""{u'divey': None, u'hipster': False, u'casual': True, u'touristy': None, u'trendy': True, u'intimate': False, u'romantic': False, u'classy': False, u'upscale': True}"", 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': 'True', 'RestaurantsTableService': 'True', 'WheelchairAccessible': 'True', 'HappyHour': 'False', 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '2', 'WiFi': ""u'free'"", 'RestaurantsReservations': 'True', 'BusinessAcceptsBitcoin': 'False', 'RestaurantsDelivery': 'None', 'BYOB': 'True', 'NoiseLevel': ""u'average'"", 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True'}","Cantonese, Seafood, Chinese, Restaurants",0.24358076563958914,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Good Harvest 大丰收,19107,Center,0.24358076563958914,0.995,0.24358076563958914

There wasn't as many banchan as I was expected (we got kimchi, seaweed, peanuts, one more we didnt really touch), but the kimchi  really was spectacular!! We had to ask for another portion of it twice. 

The seafood pancake is very good, just be careful not to eat it too quickly while you're waiting for your food to be cooking, as it can fill you up quick. I usually eat it by itself since the sauce for it can be too sweet (it was like honey!).

There was this lovely waitress who wasn't even assigned to our table, but she totally made our day! She was very kind and visited us at the right times to ask if we needed anything. Didn't bother us or hang too close constantly. Near the tail end of our time, we were somewhat full but still wanted some seafood and the sausages (super good!!), so I asked her if she could bring them out but in small portions--and she did!!

This is as gentrified as food can get, as far from asian cuisine as you need. Just an overall disappointing night.

The food was all bland and subpar. We were here for our anniversary cause of the reviews and ratings but man did this hit us hard. Lemongrass coconut soup had no taste of lemongrass, not sure if this was purposeful for the palette of the neighborhood? But it was not good. The pork belly in chili sauce was not tender, it was tough, and lacked depth. It was basically store bought chili poured over pork belly and mixed. Finally the salt and pepper shrimp/squid was so tough and the batter was so mushy. There was barely any salt and pepper flavor. And it was placed on a huge pile of greens, even though there was only a handful of protein. 

The price is way overpriced for the portion size, flavors, and overall experience. We could've gone to Chinatown for half the price and better flavors, we wanted to eXplore and that was our fault. Beware!

the service was great, nice and helpful waiters. 

the food... 
wagyu nigiri - this isn't worth it for the price. i hate that it's not slightly seared, it's ice cold and honestly made my stomach feel funny

bibimbap - we got the wagyu beef bibimbap, it was OK. nothing crazy but had good flavors and was yummy

hot pot - the entry level spicy is SPICY (trust me) stick with that or the medium broth if you're feeling daring. we got a couple of the wagyu beef options and honestly, i can't tell the difference in hot pot between wagyu beef and regular beef. maybe it's just me but i don't think the price point is worth it.
even the vegetables are priced a little higher than most hot pot placed.
the rainbow noodle portion is smalllll. it's a good amount for 2 people but that's it.

Mongolian beef dumplings

Pork soup dumplings 
Caterpillar bread

Lastly the soup dumplings were filled with hot broth that pretty much warms your soul and your left with a huge piece of pork filling.

All of their dim sum dishes are just ok, other places in the area have better variations. The one exception was the snow pea and shrimp dim sum, that was delightful. I tried their famous OG egg roll and it was just ok, nothing to write home about. It tasted good but wasn't amazing. My mother in law ordered the pan fried crispy noodles and it was really just stir fried noodles. The vegetarian dim sum was tasty per my mother in law.

-relatively affordable (dumplings, 2 soups ~$27) 
-fast service 
Those would be my main highlights of this visit. As far as taste goes, if you like meat, the soups had plenty of it. The soups were not terrible but also wasn't anything spectacular. We weren't able to finish all of the meat in our soups so I would say the portion size is pretty good.

Mongolian beef dumplings
Cheesesteak Bao

Pork soup dumplings 
Caterpillar bread

On the other hand, I think their pricing seems questionable, and I felt rather duped during my dining experience here. 

For starters, their food is meh. But what was worse is that for the dinner event being hosted at the Asian Palace, the meal was advertised as an 8-course meal (you think wow!) and then you find out it's really more like 4 large dishes that they bring out one at a time (what in the world). They included cut up oranges as part of their 8 courses for ""dessert"" (um, excuse me?). One of the ""courses"" was rice, and another ""course"" was rice crackers (o.o). Many of us at the table were definitely still hungry by the end of the meal. 

Oh another funny part of the story, dumplings were supposed to be served as part of the ""course menu"" and somehow it just got skipped. At the end of the meal, when our table asked why we had never got dumplings, they said sorry there isn't any left (I think maybe two or three other tables had gotten dumplings earlier on). We were not happy as we were still hungry, and then all of a sudden the server was like, ""actually wait, let me check"" and goes back to the kitchen. Literally 2 minutes later, they come out with multiple plates and plates of hot steaming dumplings for the different tables. Were they just lying to us before? Clearly they had cooked and ready but was just going to bypass it for some unbeknownst reason.

The interior looks largely the same, while the menu got a total makeover. Gone are the $35 unlimited hot pot and Sichuan dishes, replaced by dim sum. I would have liked to see a few more traditional dishes, but it had most of the major stuff catering to a Rittenhouse crowd. (The prices were in Rittenhouse dollars as well.)

We ordered a few different dishes: hot and sour soup, turnip cake, scallion pancakes, Brussels sprouts (why were these on a dim sum menu?), fried dumplings, crab and pork soup dumplings, and pork belly with mustard greens, which came with a side of rice. 

I knocked off a star because while most dishes were good, the turnip cake was a total miss - quite a bit overdone. I didn't find anything particularly memorable that I would come back for. We did experience quite a few issues with ordering as the kitchen had run out of a few items due to reopening the day before; I completely understand but the issue was that our server (while very nice) was not prepared with this info and had to keep coming back to us to let us know the kitchen was missing something, after we had already ordered.

It was amazing to see all the incredible food choices here. It was absolutely PACKED at lunch time on a weekday.

I love how affordable and yummy it is here :) My friends and I often default to this spot when we're in Chinatown for a number of reasons. 1) it's accommodating of larger groups (fits up to around 12 on their main large round tables) and smaller groups alike. 2) They're open from breakfast till late evening, so you could literately eat any meal there. 3) You get a solid meal for $8. It used to be cash only, but I think they take card if you order more than $15 or something (may want to verify this though!). 4) They offer great take-out and service is fast for sit-down, even though they're not always the most attentive. You're not going for a high class experience but their service suits the casual everyday occasions. Also very helpful if you can actually speak Chinese as the servers are more comfortable in Chinese (so I love going with my Chinese-speaking friends). 5) They have plenty of simple yet yummy dishes, but also offer enough options that you can try something new. The classic options would be your choice of two meats over rice or noodle. My most consistent order is probably roast pig and duck over noodle.

Pro tip: there's an actual difference between roast pork and roast pig.

As for the charsiu and roasted duck rice plate, this hit the spot. The charsiu pork and duck were perfectly cooked and seasoned. The duck skin was glistening and crispy and had a ton of meat. The rice plate also had some Chinese broccoli. 

We saw another table get the duck roll so we also got that but I wouldn't recommend it since it's about almost half the price of a 1/4 duck plate. It was good, but I wished it had more veggies in it... It just wasn't worth it in my opinion.

Ambiance: 
Wm Mulerhin's manages to create an upscale, rustic atmosphere that makes you feel like you're dining in a wealthy relative's cabin as opposed to a restaurant. The roaring fire-place and leather couches in the dining room that are often filled with bar patrons make you forget that you're right under the El in Fishtown. The whole thing feels very upscale and cozy, albeit a bit loud with the proximity of the tables and the fact that there is not a clear distinction between the bar and dining room. 

Food: 
I'll start by saying I've never eaten anything bad here - everything they made is well executed and has come out flawless every time. Their kitchen definitely knows what they're doing and holds themselves to a high standard which shows the caliber of the restaurant and the attention to detail. The first time I came here several months ago I struggled to find something I liked on the menu - though now they've updated to feature a lot more dishes that I enjoy. My advice is to check out the menu ahead of time to make sure there are dishes that call out to you - while they do a great job of cooking not all of the dishes match my personal tastes. As this is an Italian restaurant, they offer a lot of seafood options and it seems to me there are several vegetarian and vegan options available as well. 

Stand-outs for me are the brocolli rabe appetizer and the hanger and eggs for brunch - I don't normally like over easy eggs but they do them so well here I have to order it. 

Drinks: 
Much like the kitchen - the bar here knows what they're doing and their cocktails are spot on in terms of balance and flavor. You can't go wrong here ordering a cocktail you like. The selection of beer and wine are standard Italian fare. They do not seem to have an extensive wine cellar or wine by the bottle offerings which may deter some folks, though I'm sure all of their wine by the glass can be purchased by the bottle as well even though not explicitly quoted on the menu. 

Service:
While it's clear the servers here are pulled from top notch establishments and have knowledge of the menu, the overall service lacks the refinement of a five-star establishment. My drinks tend to sit empty here for several minutes before being topped off and the little touches such as being offered spreads for my croissant or a steak knife are lacking unless I explicitly ask. For some of you this won't bother you, but I was a bit disappointed as having to go back and forth with the wait-staff can throw off the pace of a meal a good bit. That said - the service is definitely good and friendly. 

Value:
Why 4 stars? Everything is good here and well-made, however Wm Mulerhins lacks the magic to make this a 5 star experience. While I've never had a bad experience I've also never felt compelled to rave about this place to my friends either or to bring guests from out of town - it's kind of just a nice spot to eat when I don't feel like going to Center City. Some dishes are better value than others, but ultimately it's comparable if a little bit less than center city prices which is fine for what they offer and the neighborhood. I would say go value-wise, but for the reasons described not a place that I would use for a special occasion.",Wm Mulherin's Sons,19122,"{'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'GoodForDancing': 'False', 'RestaurantsReservations': 'True', 'GoodForKids': 'False', 'WiFi': ""u'free'"", 'NoiseLevel': ""u'average'"", 'OutdoorSeating': 'True', 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '3', 'HasTV': 'False', 'Ambience': ""{'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'classy': True, 'casual': False}"", 'BestNights': ""{'monday': False, 'tuesday': False, 'friday': True, 'wednesday': False, 'thursday': True, 'sunday': False, 'saturday': True}"", 'WheelchairAccessible': 'True', 'DogsAllowed': 'False', 'RestaurantsAttire': ""'casual'"", 'Alcohol': ""u'full_bar'"", 'BikeParking': 'True', 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': 'True', 'Music': ""{'dj': False, 'background_music': False, 'no_music': False, 'jukebox': False, 'live': False, 'video': False, 'karaoke': False}"", 'CoatCheck': 'True', 'GoodForMeal': ""{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': None, 'dinner': True, 'brunch': None, 'breakfast': False}"", 'Smoking': ""u'no'"", 'BusinessParking': ""{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}"", 'HappyHour': 'False', 'RestaurantsTableService': 'True', 'Caters': 'False', 'RestaurantsDelivery': 'True', 'RestaurantsTakeOut': 'True', 'BusinessAcceptsBitcoin': 'False'}","Restaurants, Tapas/Small Plates, Italian, Szechuan, Cocktail Bars, Pizza, Chinese, Bars, Nightlife",0.18027441485068607,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Wm Mulherin's Sons,19122,North,0.18027441485068607,0.9976,0.18027441485068607

The ambience was hip and it seemed like a great place to hang out with friends.

Service was ok for a super busy night. 

Food: Everything is family style so order according to how hungry everyone at your table is.

General Tso Soup Dumpling: I love soup dumplings. This was... ok. I wouldn't get it again and pay for it myself, but if someone else got it/paid for it, I wouldn't mind eating it. 

Shrimp Dumpling: The traditional har gow is 20000x better. I get that this is a fusion place, so I shouldn't complain too much. 

Beef Chow Fun: The best dish we got. Can't really screw this one up. The beef was tender and the noodles were perfectly chewy (not overcooked). 

Lobster Fried Rice: It was ok. Yea, that's all I have to say. 

Peking Duck: Another dish that you can't really screw up. Loved the crispy skin and the sauces that came with. 

Dim Sum sampler: Two each of chicken & ginger, shrimp, pork, edamame dumplings. The edamame was.... interesting. It's a paste consistency .... like red bean paste buns. 


So as you can probably guess, my experience of the food was meh. The price was just waaaay to expensive for the quality of the food. I think they charge more for the experience and the hip ambience.

I highly, highly, highly recommend you do not use Uber Eats (The prices of the menu are higher then the normal prices on the restaurants menu and they will actually charge you even if the Uber Eats delivery person cancels your order).

That being said the review detailed below is unbiased from the Uber Eats delivery that took place for this order and is soley based on the food.

Steamed Pork Soup Dumplings - These were decent I would rate slighly below Dim Sum Garden quality which is the barometer that all Dim Sum is measured by in my opinion. Comes with not soy sauce but a sweeter verison of soy sauce I want to say.

Shanghai Shumai - Well this item was very different. Had rice in it and a sticky like substance - first time I have tried this item and I appreciate the dish but I would not get again. The color of the food dye or whatever is in the item makes the Shumai appear blood red.

Shrimp Lo Mein - A fair amount of shrimp. The noodles to me tasted thicker and more starchy then other Lo Mein dishes I am used to however it is not oily / greasy like most places that serve Lo Mein so it's a catch 22 depending on your preference. For the record I did enjoy this lo mein quite a bit but cannot indulge in such a high carb item often.

It is definitely authentic, where they still push the carts around. Definitely able to get the dishes you can get in Hong Kong (my parents are HKers, I lived in HK for 2 years). Nowadays, HK dim sum has become so fancy. This restaurant is not that kind of place. This kind of dim sum takes you to the classic shrimp dumpling, siu mai, spareribs, sticky rice, turnip cake, etc. They also have classic native HK dim sum dishes like chinese donut wrapper in rice sheets, various congee, and bean curd chicken/mushroom wraps (dunno what they are called in english).  While you can get all of these dishes, I think they lack in quality. It's missing the freshness that you would get as compared to another place. The rice sheets are too thick and the shrimp dumpling has too thick of skin. Some of the fried items are not as fresh when I get them, and sometimes tastes like they were fried twice after not being sold the day before (or earlier that day). 

I speak to the workers in Cantonese, but the service has not been bad when I've gone. Always been able to sit down pretty quickly. They accept credit card there, but I think they charge a fee for it (which I never know about). Overall, the price of it was not too bad. It may be a little bit more costly, but for the variety that me and a friend had, it was only $15/person.

Shrimp Siu Mai - $12 for eight extremely well portioned Shrimp with a Pea on top, thats right a Pea. I mean it works!! I believe this is defined as one of the Cantonese big three staple items and my god it blew me away like no other. Please if you are a fan of Shrimp get this item ASAP!!

Beef-Stuffed Scallion Pancakes - Three servings of this dish and it is quite good. Fried all be it but different and not bad. My one qualm is no sauces were given to me in my entire order but I am assuming was by mistake you can't deliver these two items without sauces and expect to get five stars???

Shanghai Wonton Soup - $8.00 wonton soup. I knew I was getting ripped off when I ordered this but really wanted soup. DO NOT GET THIS. You will be disappointed. Not even good, was a very big let down but I think the restaurant knows what its doing and making a great profit on people that really want soup as this is the cheapest verison of wonton soup they offer.

Eggplant Garlic Sauce - I literally own a mug that says give me eggplant or give me death so one of the things I can do is critique eggplant dishes. This dish has a wonderful amount of spice, not too much but bordering on too much spice for the casual diner. I really enjoyed this dish but it was not great when reheated.

Based all my first experience here I would defintely be up for a visit once the COVID-19 Pandemic is over....I am just hopping it is BYOB as this order cost me over $51 for one person worth of take out.

Little Sheep is a chain out of China that does Mongolian style hot pot. If you don't know what that is, it's basically Chinese fondue. You order your dishes raw and then cook them in communally shared pots of broth - with some variation on flavors available.

I love hot pot, and Little Sheep delivers. It is not 100% authentic but it is also not the westernized kind of Chinese food you may be used to so if you are unfamiliar with hot pot, come in with an open mind. If you expect general tso's chicken and crab rangoons you are likely to be disappointed.

The buffet consists of lots of food, mostly veggies and tofu that you can add to your pot but you will also have a chance to order specialty meats to be delivered (raw) to your table. Try everything. Especially the fish balls stuffed with roe. Absolutely delicious!

Now, you may have seen that I mentioned the service was ""pretty Chinese"" let me explain that in China you do not get the same kind of service as in America. The waitresses don't check in on you and ask how things are or if you need a drink refill. In china, when you want service, you literally just shout ""WAITRESS!!!"" and a server comes to your table. Little sheep is perhaps a hair more attentive than this but be prepared to flag someone down when you want something. 

There is a lot of great food in Philly, especially in this part of Philly and Little Sheep is a great experience. But $25 feels a little pricey to me. I've also been to this location on several occasions and found that when they switched to the buffet style, the selection and quality suffered a bit. That isn't to say the place isn't fantastic, it IS! But as someone who went there before the change, I preferred ordering everything from the table and the change causes me to rate a star lower.

If you've never had hot pot, Little Sheep is a great place to try it for the first time. And if you have, it's still a great place to get your fix. Check this place out.

I'd lived in China for five years and fallen in love with Beijing/Peking Duck in that time. When I moved back, this was presented to me as the spot to go for said dish. And they do carry it, which is more than I can say for the majority of roast duck spots in Philly Chinatown, which roast it normally, but then primarily serve it on rice platters or, at best, in bao buns. Sang Kee does it right in that regard - you get dozens of thin slices of duck, spring onion stalks, sweet bean sauce, and wraps/""pancakes"" to use as your delivery method, taco style. It mildly disappointed me that they don't give cucumber stalks along with the spring onion, but my main issue was the wraps - they're so much larger and starchier than basically any others I've ever had! And so, while I was happy it had introduced some of my friends to the idea of the dish, I always rolled my eyes a bit like the pain-in-the-rear China snob I am when they spoke highly of Sang Kee.

Well, fast forward to a couple of weeks ago, when they re-opened for takeout after a brief Covid closing. After noticing what killer business local roast duck rival Siu Kee had been doing selling just duck platters during the early days of the quarantine, I was outright fiending for roast duck. And then I saw that Sang Kee was reopening and took it for a sign. 

My girlfriend and I ordered a whole-duck Peking Duck platter and I requested in the order that they include the carcass so I could make some soup with it. 

The first good development/sign was that they were cool with my request, so the value of the meal immediately at least doubled. 

The second was pretty basic - I enjoyed the Peking duck! I'm sure part of it had to do with me not expecting a petite wrap anymore and having adjusted expectations, but the fact remains that if it hadn't all tasted good together, I wouldn't have just said I enjoyed the meal. And I wouldn't have made this a 4-star review. The dish is just such a killer use of duck that as long as the meat and sauce are done right, it would be hard not to like it. I got more than one meal out of just the proper Peking duck part of the meal, too.

The fact that I was able to make a soup, which was possibly my driving factor in wanting duck at that point, locked in the fact that I am very glad that Sang Kee is open again. I now clearly see that I was too harsh on them in the past, and now I'm looking forward to seeing what they can do with more standard Chinese platters.",Sang Kee Peking Duck House,19107,"{'Alcohol': ""u'full_bar'"", 'BikeParking': 'True', 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': 'True', 'RestaurantsReservations': 'True', 'Caters': 'True', 'OutdoorSeating': 'False', 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'RestaurantsTakeOut': 'True', 'GoodForKids': 'True', 'Corkage': 'False', 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '2', 'BusinessParking': ""{'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}"", 'BYOBCorkage': ""'yes_free'"", 'RestaurantsAttire': ""'casual'"", 'WiFi': ""u'no'"", 'NoiseLevel': ""u'average'"", 'ByAppointmentOnly': 'False', 'DogsAllowed': 'False', 'Ambience': ""{'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'classy': True, 'casual': True}"", 'RestaurantsTableService': 'True', 'BusinessAcceptsBitcoin': 'False', 'RestaurantsDelivery': 'True', 'BYOB': 'False', 'HappyHour': 'False', 'GoodForMeal': ""{u'breakfast': False, u'brunch': None, u'lunch': True, u'dinner': True, u'latenight': None, u'dessert': False}"", 'WheelchairAccessible': 'True', 'HasTV': 'False'}","Restaurants, Noodles, Dim Sum, Hong Kong Style Cafe, Cantonese, Food, Barbeque, Juice Bars & Smoothies, Chinese",0.17620060790273556,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,Sang Kee Peking Duck House,19107,Center,0.17620060790273556,0.9922,0.17620060790273556

I always end up at this spot when going through China Town. I believe this is the case as there is ample seating and they had an extensive menu in the past. For delivery they do not offer all of there menu options at this time.

Roti Canai - I really love this item and only have tried it twice in my life. You are looking at $5.00 anymore and I think your getting hosed as the naan bread does not cost alot for the portion size they give you and it comes with a very small container of sauce with two pieces of chicken and one potato in the sauce.

Seafood Lo Mein - I was not planning on ordering this but the menu states : Squid, scallops, shrimp, and vegetables in Lo Mein for $13. Well, There are about 2-3 Shrimps and the tail is still on them in Lo Mein? Really dude... There is also maybe 2 1/2 baby sized scallops, also some minced squid. The Lo Mein was different however, the noodles were very light / thin and not the normal Lo Mein I was expecting. It worked for the dish but I would not come back to order this item as it did not meet my expectations.

House Special Squid - If I saw a picture of this item before ordering it online I would have not ordered it. Back in the day this location literally had items on the menu that said ask your server if you would like as they had some interesting items that are local favorites from localities in Maylasia, Thai Land, and Cambodia. I was expecting something more unique then small pieces of squid and minced squid in an abundance of sauce. But sometimes we take chances in life right and learn from it.

What I have learned from my experience is next time I am in China Town to try another location.

The staff are friendly and hope you weren't waiting for the table and sitting down. The tables are numbered so it's easy to identify. And if you wear your mask you can certainly go inside and use the restroom. Other than that, no one enters. Besides the staff

The food here is delicious and a small bit on the pricey side but it's worth it for the location, scenery, and atmosphere.

We fancy the caterpillar bread, the cheesesteak bao, the Dan Dan noodles, and the Koji beef.

Right off the bat we noticed that the service was better than the price point demanded. Not just our server, but the entire staff. This was made doubly evident by the way they have handled the covid-mandated social distancing. They really did a spectacular job of being considerate. I would even say they brought a new level of professionalism to it. If you were ever going to risk outdoor dining during this time, this is the restaurant to do it at. So many little touches that I would never have even thought of were changed to their process to make it feel safe and comfortable.

Cocktails were ordered first: a Sister Francis and a Just Drink It. The former was nice but nothing remarkable. The latter was excellent and recommended. The price point on both were fair.

First course was the crispy octopus. I've never had octopus breaded this way, and the pesto plus white bean puree really brought it together. Make sure you get some arugula on your bites as it perfectly accents.

Second course was pasta. Cavatelli and Maloreddus. This is where the night really took off. The Maloreddus was simply fantastic, a traditional tasting dish kicked up by the saffron and fennel. Really I will get this every time I come here from now on. The cavatelli was in some ways the best dish of the night. It was so unique, so well made, so unlike any other pasta dish I've ever had. A lovely combination of unami, savory, an earthy flavors. Even visually the dish was uniquely appealing, as the pasta was a dark, nearly squid ink black color. Portion sizes were enough that they could be your entree, but they were just a smidge less than normal pasta portions at a more traditional Italian place.

Restaurants across Philly are taking the plunge into outdoor dining. While admittedly some are fish out of water, Wm. Mulherin's Sons goes out of its way to amp up its outdoor experience. Half in the sun and half in the shade, the block of sidewalk against the north wall of the restaurant-hotel is dolled up with area rugs and a pop playlist. The space is smattered with two- and four-seater metal black tables and wooden-and-metal folding chairs, each separated from one another by many light-decorated plants. Opt for a table on the building side of the block to avoid the sun as best as possible.

My partner and I decided to brave the suffocating summer humidity to take a break from our homemade meals. Upon our waitress's recommendations we opted for the Whipped Sheep's Milk Ricotta, the Fried Soft Shell Crab, and the Leslie Chow pizza, complemented by the Birds, Bees & Italians and the I Dare Youse cocktails.

The ricotta itself tasted like a savory whipped cream with strong notes of mint, balanced out by the salty and olive oily Foccacia, which tasted particularly of grilled rosemary. The crab was battered in a light coat of cornmeal, sitting atop a zucchini slaw and incredibly flavorful garlic aioli. Finally, our pizza, while vegetarian, carried a  generous load of mushrooms with a balsamic-like drizzle. I was most pleasantly surprised that the crispy thin crust held up despite being loaded with toppings.

For just about $100, we shared a decently large meal and drinks -- a fair enough price by Philly standards. I've been meaning to give Wm. Mulherin's Sons a whirl for some time, but I've never quite followed through until now.

We got two orders of pork soup dumplings, a caterpillar bread, and dan dan noodles to share. The soup dumplings were the best of the trio and had a lot of soup in each dumping. The vinegar and ginger sauce on the side could have come with a few more slices of ginger and although the soup was plenty it did not have a rich pork flavor. These came 4 for $9 when other places in Philly will give you 6 or 8 soup dumplings for the same price.

The caterpillar bread was disappointing for the price, $10 for a bit of pulled pork in bread with honey drizzled on the plate. The dan dan noodles were okay but the beef was a bit salty for my taste and the noodles were too hard/chewy.

The only barrier (literally) was that when you step inside the landing, there are large cardboard boxes barricading the way towards the food counter, so you have to stick your head through and shout at the lady to get her attention if she's not in the front. This leaves little room for customers to line up inside - I guess this is intentional for social distancing purposes. Don't be turned off if she's a little cold with customers, you definitely don't come here for polite customer service, but she is very straightforward with answering questions.

*Combination Box: These are generally $9 each right now. It comes with a pint-sized portion of white rice (extra rice is possible for extra $$) topped with steamed Chinese veggies (usually something like yu choy / choy sum) and your choice of meat. When we came, there was no more roast pig, so we opted for ginger scallion chicken and roast duck. No regrets there, this place lives up to its name of being a Duck House! Beautifully flavored savory roast duck with great texture. The ginger scallion chicken is very generously flavored, almost on the salty side, but still delicious. The pieces are on the smaller more chewy side which seems more traditional, and not the typical chunky white American chicken breast cut of chicken. 
*Honey BBQ Pork Belly:  This as well as the roast pig normally costs $15/lb as a side dish, so we ordered it just as a side. She only had two thirds of a pound left so we took it all. It's char siu flavor, super authentic, not too sweet (I don't like it too sweet anyway). 

Our party of four got full enough off of three combination boxes plus the side order of 2/3 lb of honey BBQ pork belly.

Granted, I've been to Sampan many times over the past 5 years for happy hour and dinner since moving back home but revisiting any familiar place during COVID, with all the changes and restrictions, makes the experience strange and new. 

A close friend who I also had not seen since March made a reservation (no just walking up and claiming a table) so we could have an after work happy hour. We both arrived, masked, just a few minutes before 3 while the masked hostess outdoors was setting up her station with paper menus and hand sanitizer. She showed us to a table for 2 set up against the outside wall of Sampan. Tables were all 6 feet apart and a portion of the street in front of the restaurant was also cordoned off and made into a dining area. Again, tables were correctly distanced. 

Our table was on a distinct tilt; not bad enough so that eating implements and food rolled off but significant enough that we were not 100% comfortable. On the other hand, it was preferable to sitting in the street as regular, Friday Philly traffic rolled noisily and closely by.  

All tables were bare for easy cleaning between patrons. Our server, masked and gloved, took our order and chatted happily with us about being very glad to be back to work again. We told her we were utterly sick of our own cooking and, in Nick's case, delivered food. The atmosphere here was noisy (sirens, motorbikes, raised voices, horns honking) but festive. Not everyone (other than Sampan staff) we saw was wearing a mask. Of course, those seated and enjoying their food and drink were sans mask, but that was to be expected. 

Nick and I ordered what we usually would have had in pre-COVID days-the house special cocktail (a cranberry/vodka spritzer on this day-very weak), happy hour priced edamame dumplings, crab rangoon, beef skewers, kim chee fried rice, roasted brussels sprouts and roasted shisito peppers. By now, we had several masked servers attending our table, thus the food was coming out rather quickly, crowding our small, tilty table top. 

Happy hour prices have not changed and you'll still get a solid meal if the happy hour bites are going to be your dinner. No shame in that at all. The fried rice was not quite as we remembered; still a very plentiful serving but seeming a bit underseasoned, lackluster and very light on the kim chee. Like what I find at almost every restaurant that offers shisito peppers, these were more soggy than fried/lightly charred; as well, they were served in an oddish way-a big bowl heaped with peppers (making them MORE soggy as they sat and steamed together) with the 'dipping' sauce smeared on one side of the bowl in a thin swathe. This made the peppers hard to 'dip' so we wound up using first a knife, then our fingers, (since it was just the 2 of us) to retrieve some sauce for our peppers. That finger thing isn't something I'd do if I were to eat with a group, though. Regular plates and utensils were used for serving, but chopsticks and napkins were disposable. 

We ate, had several drinks, caught up on the doings and not doings of each other's post-COVID lives and people watched. Not everyone who had a reservation was masked and patrons who were walking around-heading to or returning from the restroom, meeting other members of their party-were usually not masked, either. There also seemed to be a line of people either waiting for their reservation time, or seeing if they could get a spot. There was absolutely no social distancing in the line, most of those waiting were not masked and some of the people were actively hanging onto/leaning on each other. Sure-probably lovers and/or good friends (one would hope)-but still...

Between the traffic and the din of people at last let out of long confinement, lots of unmasked patrons passing our table, the noise level that was fairly high, plus the tilt of the table all made it hard to relax in spite of having quaffed several adult beverages. As a result, we cut our time short, got the check which arrived quickly, paid, tipped generously and headed off to our respective destinations. 

Would I go back? Probably not for awhile. I'm curious to try other outdoor dining situations, like Salty's, K'Far, Zahav's patio and BarBombon's charming looking alley seating. Heck, even a take out picnic in Rittenhouse Square would tickle me.

Philly's own Sampan passed this test with flying colors, serving their customers with food, away from their home. I chose this restaurant to temporarily fulfill my immense and everlasting hunger because of its ability to unite artisan mainland China cuisine with the popular Japanese dish,すし or sushi.
     Per usual, my experience eating out was an emotional roller coaster. Although I had made a 6:45 reservation, my team and I endured a 15 and a half minute wait before being helped to a table on a quaint side street. The chairs they used were comparable to the street itself, but once my rump went totally numb, I found the city noise created a pleasant ambience for my meal.
    Although the staff treated us with the utmost respect and compassion, the flimsy paper menus missed the mark for me, I also would've loved to see some more kid friendly options such as General Tsos Chicken Nuggets and French fry fried rice. After perusing the menu's extensive and expensive choices I went with the Kimchi fried rice, yellowtail sushami, toro roll, blue crab sushi, General Tsos soup dumplings, A-5 Kobe beef (RIP), and a strawberry lemonade. The yellowtail really hit the spot for me, as the southern tang coupled with the tropical fish fostered a cultural paradigm in my mouth. That, along with my soup dumplings, fried rice, and the homeless man harassing the families across the street were the clear highlights of my meal. 
     Although the prices were somewhat egregious, this restaurant inspires greatness with its high end Asian cuisine which I hope will be a catalyst for the city of Philadelphia as a whole. All in all, Sampan provided me with a unforgettable experience that will sit with me for a lifetime.

The outdoor dining area, although right on the street is made inviting by several planter benches with colorful vinca flowers.  Our server wore a mask and gloves, despite the heat, and was very friendly and professional.  

Dan Dan is a bit overpriced and portions are small compared to other good Chinese food options.  We were here for lunch, although they do not offer lunch specials.  It was a standard menu.  We ordered the Ginger Scallion Chicken and the Scallion Pancakes.  Both items were really good.

They have a huge variety of a lot of classic Chinese American takeout on their menu.  My partner and I ordered it off of seamless, and we really enjoyed everything we got. The price isn't terrible, and the portions are super generous and fed us for another whole meal. 

We ordered the sweet and sour chicken, sesame chicken, walnut shrimp, and Szechuan style pork along with an appetizer of two egg rolls and crab wontons.  The sesame chicken and the walnut shrimp were my two personal faves, and they really packed the takeout container with a ton of meat rather than filling it up with filler veggies. Everything tasted delicious and as expected, and really hit the spot for fulfilling our takeout craving. The order came with two generous portions of white rice, and we weren't charged extra for it.

The only two downsides to the meal were that the dipping sauce with the sweet and source pork was super watered down for some reason? And not as flavorful as I was expecting, and then also our order through Seamless was almost an hour late from the projected time we got, even when we ordered ahead of time.

I understand that prices went up, just didnt realize what I was used to paying $7/8 in NY would cost me almost 3 bucks more. Anyway, the food itself was prettty darn good. When I watched the man cutting my roast pork, I was a little nervous because the piece looked like it was on the leaner side and I like half lean/half fatty roast pork but nope, the pieces I got were reallly tender, very flavorful and just really good.

They have limited seating but hot pot is alive again! First impression, the food is extremely high quality and their fish balls are homemade as well as noodles. They are going for the niche and quality food. They also have a promotion of buy 1 get 1 for select meat orders, a la carte. Honest, the homemade colorful noodles are pretty but impossible to eat. Very chewy regardless of how long you cook it. The fish balls are a MUST try, very delicious, we got the combo first and then ordered separately. The food selection is plentiful and our party of 5 had a wonderful time. They also have multiple different soup bases with individual pots. They sent us a sauce tray, the options were very dry not very sauce like however, they have a homemade sauce thats delicious!

Nan Zhou Hand Drawn Noodle House is delicious, fairly priced, and authentic. That should be all you need to know to check it out right now!

For more details, read on:

NZHDNH serves a great variety of Chinese noodle dishes (many in soup, some dry) and assorted appetizers and side dishes (dumplings and veggie dishes primarily) and everything is fantastic.

The dumplings are plump and flavorful.
The veggies are perfectly prepared.
The dry noodle dishes are filling and flavorful.
The soups are divine.

I've sampled each of the following items:
Scallion Pancake
Shredded Kelp in Sauce
Cold Shredded Potatoes
Barbeque Lamb Stick
Marinated Duck
Braised Sliced Beef Noodle Soup
Beef Brisket Noodle Soup
Roast Duck Noodle Soup
Beef Tendon Noodle Soup
Ox Tail Noodle Soup
Lamb Noodle Soup
Noodle w. Peanut Sauce
Sesame Cold Noodles
Szechuan Cold Noodle
Boy Choy w. Fresh Garlic
Coconut Chicken Curry Dumpling
Mixed Veg Dumpling

And literally everything was savory, delicious and something I would order again (assuming I wasn't actively trying to order literally everything on the menu).

The place has an unassuming front, and often a wait when a convention is in town, but wait or not, this place is worth it.

Philly's Chinatown has no shortage of great food but this might be the best place of them all. Hidden a little bit off the main drag, and not offering the standard Americanized Chinese food many places are known for may make it easy to overlook but that would be a mistake.

As someone who has lived in China and is constantly on the lookout for good, fresh, delicious Chinese cuisine I have found a lot of places in Philly that are good. Nan Zhou Hand Drawn Noodle House is great. 

While you wont find you traditional American Chinese staples here (no genreal tso's, no pork fried rice) you will find a wide variety of savory and comforting foods. There should be something on this menu for everyone and even the least adventurous among you shouldn't balk at a noodle soup with sliced brisket. And I do recommend the noodle soups as the best of the best in a menu of nothing but great options.

For the most adventurous you can try something more traditional like ox tail or beef tendon. 

Regardless, order a noodle soup, add a splash of the vinegar on the table and spoonful of the ground chili in oil. And bask in comfort as the warms flows through you and soothes your soul with every bite.

We had a reservation and were seated at a table that might have barely made 20""s in width.   It was tight and cramped and very close to a large beam that obstructed view as well as made it even tighter to sit.   After asking our waiter to move to a better seat we were told there were none available.  After speaking to 2 managers, Kris and Yolanda, we were told we could not be accommodated because we were a couple of two when right across from us was a couple of two that had a conveniently larger seating area and they arrived 20 mins after we did.  As well as the several empty booths that were available and never used.  At 9:30 pm we were told there were incoming reservations, unknowing that the last reservation is taken at 9:45 pm. 
    As a business professional in the customer service industry and my spouse being a doctor that deals with people daily, we were less than pleased with the lack of understanding and courtesy.  Our waiter was great but I really feel the management dropped the ball in what was supposed to be a great Friday evening out.  $300 later I have to say I was not impressed and would likely not come back to this restaurant.  
    Its more than just food.  Appearance, punctuality, courtesy, and understanding go a long way in the customer service industry and I came here with very high hopes and was severely let down.
    Our meal... Honestly for what we spent $$$  I would have rather ordered chinese takeout and watched netflix and chilled.   
    The cost would have mattered not if we were treated like our comfort mattered in what we thought was an upscale restaurant.

It's a simple concept: If the restaurant skimps on sauce packets in an effort to cut costs, this usually translates to other cost cutting measures. Most often in the form of poor service and food quality.

For reference we got the Moo Shu Chicken, an egg roll, and General Tso's Chicken

1. The General Tso wasn't very good, cost nearly $15 for a very small amount, and we were charged an extra $1.50 for subbing brown rice which made the dish very expensive 

2. There was an option to order from a few different platforms online and each had different menu items listed and drastically different prices so I decided to call

3. When I called I wasn't given a total or estimated delivery time 

4. The Moo Shu was absolutely terrible (see photo). I had to add salt AND soy sauce to the dish to make it edible. It also had A LOT of egg and very very very little chicken. It also was lacking in mushrooms, which I love. It was basically egg and cabbage (again little chicken and mushrooms). I am honestly very upset and disappointed.

Highly recommend this place for some soup dumplings in the Philly area. First time here, during COVID restrictions, we were one of the few customers on a week night. We had the soup dumplings, rice cake and the taiwanese fried chicken. The fried chicken is a big portion and a must try, really well seasoned and delicious. The rice cake was good, a little under seasoned and oilu but still good. I do recommend trying their soup dumplings while they are hot, we waited a little too long and they were stale.

The location is small and they've scaled down to just move all the pastries up to the front of the store. They now take credit card, but prefer cash only. They have a variety of breakfast/lunch pastries such as egg tarts, pork floss buns, hot dog buns, vanilla cream buns, taro/red-bean buns, sponge cakes and more. 

They're quick, the breads are mostly $1-2 in price. They are delicious, filling and individually wrapped for you.

I legit could not get enough of it even as I was eating it. Even thinking about it now, I just might order it again today. I asked for it to be spicy because I really like spicy food. It wasn't as spicy as I wanted (I have a ridiculous spice tolerance so it was probably okay for most people) so I added some of my own pepper myself. The Kung Po Triple Crown was okay. Also had to make adjustment to it with my pepper and I wish there was a lot more protein in it. I definitely enjoyed the shrimp fried rice more, hence why I stuck to that the second time I ordered from them. 

The portion sizes are also incredibly generous. With those two meals, I was able to eat lunch and dinner for like 2-3 days. Probably would have lasted even longer if I hadn't overstuffed myself the first day with the shrimp fried rice and wings.

American Dream Roll - I was expecting this to be gourmet from all the premium ingredients in the roll and the price. Far, far, below my expectations.

Kao Pao Shrimp - So listen to this folks you pay $15.50 and need to pay $5.00 which is a discount from the $7.00 they charge for fried rice! To simplify you get NO RICE for $15.50 order for Kao Pao Shrimp!! This dish is also a bit too spicy to enjoy and not worth the money.

Miso Soup - $5.50 for a quart of Miso Soup...really??

Also, they do not read any special requests I wrote please make the Philadelphia roll with just avocado and cream cheese and they disregarded, I even wrote I would pay extra if it cost more to put avocado in it instead of Salmon.

It was cold that evening and I wanted to eat that soup dumping and a few other dim sum dishes.

While they may not be the best XLB but they were pretty good. 

My other favorite dish was garlic snow pea leaves.   I could just have this green and white rice, and be happy. 豆苗 is my favorite leafy green and I memorized Chinese characters so I know to always spot this dish wherever I go at a Chinese restaurant around the world. 

Be sure to leave room fit desert as they have egg tarts on their dim sum menu. Actually we got so full, we took these egg tarts back to the hotel.  Naturally I ate both of them 2 hours later. Of that really completed my night. Good egg tarts finish my day right.

Reasonable price for the volume of food in each dish.

After a long flight from across the country, being frustrated with TSA and people not knowing how to wear masks properly, I wanted something that was comforting and familiar. Luckily, Han Dynasty was close by and made me feel better after a long and arduous day. 

I had been here once before for a conference, but getting the experience living in the city is quite different. For now, it's either pick up or delivery, and it was nice to see that they were very cautious, and only allow people wearing masks to pick up food. I ordered some of the usual sichuan dishes, such as mapo tofu, water boiled beef, twice cooked pork, and string beans. After sampling almost every sichuan restaurant in my previous city of Houston, I can say that Han Dynasty can stand with the best. The mapo tofu has a wonderful texture, it wasn't broken up, and actually uses the right style of tofu. Water boiled beef had a great flavor, just enough sichuan peppercorn, and wasn't too greasy. The twice cooked pork was also really good, but it was half leeks and less meat than I would expect. String beans were cooked perfectly, just how I like it.

The price isn't terrible for the location, but it is more expensive than I am used to. Then again, I am new to the city so my needle has to probably change a bit. If you're already familiar with the dishes and are ordering online, it can be a bit confusing, since they go by ""style"". I would have also liked to have some more rice with my food. I ordered 4 dishes and only got 2 little to go containers of rice, which felt a bit skimpy.

Overall, this is going to probably be my new local. The flavor is great, resonably priced, and does an excellent job of protecting their customers and staff.

We ordered around 6PM on a Friday night, and our order was set to be ready by 6:45PM so really quick turnaround. We did deliver, and our delivery guy followed directions and left our order outside our door, which worked out very well. For eats, we both ordered the dan dan noodles as our main (felt like we couldn't not get them!) and split the scallion pancakes as an app. The scallion pancakes were OK - they were very greasy so must have been fried in lots of oil. That being said, they were tasty but that might have been a byproduct of the heavy deep fry. They were served with soy sauce, which was a nice touch, but we couldn't get past the grease. On the other hand, the dan dan noodles were very nicely done. They were coded as a 3/5 spice, but boy, were they spicy! Our noses were both running the entire time. The flavors of the dish were very good though - the sauce was strong and rich, but not over powering the noodles themselves, which were nicely done and clearly homemade. The minced pork meshed well with the overall dish, but the minced nature made the meat get a little lost in the noodles, which was disappointing. Outside of that, there appeared to be a few green onions and bean sprouts mixed in as well, but some extra veggies would have added to the dish too. But overall, we did really enjoy the dan dan and could tell it was a much elevated dish from traditional lo mein. The price of the dish was extremely reasonable (~$10 on UberEats), but the portions were HUGE! We split one dish between the two of us and were incredibly full after. So definitely worth the price!
We enjoyed our takeout meal from Dan Dan, and we were overall pleased with our selections. We will probably opt for a less greasy app next time, and we will explore other (less spicy) noodle and entree options too to give the entire menu a chance.

I got the fried rice noodles with vegetable, Vietnamese noodle roll, sweet tofu dessert, and a mango passionfruit green tea all for takeout. Still couldn't believe how affordable this place was. 

Fried rice noodles were decent although a bit cold. It wasn't a big deal since I could just pop it in the microwave. For less than $3 you really can't complain. The container might look small, but the lady really packed a lot of noodles in there. As for the Vietnamese noodle rolls, I was sad that they didn't have Vietnamese ham on top like the advertised photo. Maybe they just ran out? Well nonetheless, it was pretty good and for the price it's an amazing value. 

Sweet tofu was delicious and it satisfied my cravings. Sweet tofu is a childhood favorite of mine and it's been years since I've had any. So glad I found a place I can come back to grab some more. As for drinks, their options were a bit more limited. They didn't have oolong tea, but they asked if I liked fruit tea. Their mango passionfruit green tea is pretty good.

I always order the chicken egg foo young and the best part is the gravy, rich and flavorful, I can't get enough of it. I also love the BBQ ribs and I must have extra chinese mustard with it.
I really like the pan fried dumplings, just right with the crisp outter dough and a gooey pork filling. 
I also enjoy the pork yat mein which has the aforementioned delicious gravy, tender slices of roast pork, noodles and chopped raw onions.

My wife and I have been here multiple times!  We love strolling through the aisles, looking at everything that is for sale. Seeing if they have anything new!

On our most recent trip (during covid), it was sadly very depressing...  We went on the Friday after Thanksgiving.  About 20% of the shops were closed...  There was no indoor seating...  If you did manage to find a chair that wasnt removed, security came along fast to move you along...  My wife is 8 months pregnant, so they let her be for the most part.

So since the last trip was a little dismal, I will post what we have come to love about this place.  We LOVE the cookies from the PA General Store.  OMG soooooooo amazing!  Soft and chewy.... such a delight.  After the first time we only bought 2 cookies, now we know to get 2-3 dozen! hahahaha!

I am a huge fan of Corned Beef and Pastrami, but as a NYer, we know Jewish style is the best!  Places by us are $30-40 per lb, or 20+ a sandwich, but good ol Hershels is a normal price!  $10 per sandwich, and $14 per lb!  Its worth it to drive down lol!

Since we arent locals, the produce isnt that big for us, but we love getting spices and seasonings from the Head Nut and the Herbiary.

We also love getting unique items from Amys place!  Highly recommend!

They also have several butchers that you can get fresh meats from.  We really love getting sausages and so many other items like steaks and sometimes fish.  Dont forget a cooler!

They also have about 10 stores that are direct from Lancaster Amish country!    Fresh butter, fresh eggs, fresh produce!  Make sure that you stop at Beilers for a donut and cake!  Millers also does amazing pretzels!  Make sure that you like butter.

If there is something that you are looking for, and do not know where to get it, 99% of the time, you can find everything that you need here!",Reading Terminal Market,19107,"{'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': 'True', 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '2', 'Corkage': 'False', 'BikeParking': 'True', 'RestaurantsAttire': ""'casual'"", 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'GoodForKids': 'True', 'Alcohol': ""'beer_and_wine'"", 'NoiseLevel': ""u'loud'"", 'RestaurantsReservations': 'False', 'GoodForMeal': ""{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': False, 'brunch': True, 'breakfast': True}"", 'BYOBCorkage': ""'yes_free'"", 'DogsAllowed': 'False', 'BusinessParking': ""{'garage': True, 'street': True, 'validated': True, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}"", 'Ambience': ""{'touristy': True, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'classy': True, 'casual': False}"", 'Caters': 'False', 'WiFi': ""u'no'"", 'HasTV': 'True', 'OutdoorSeating': 'None', 'RestaurantsDelivery': 'True', 'RestaurantsTakeOut': 'True', 'ByAppointmentOnly': 'False'}","Candy Stores, Shopping, Department Stores, Fast Food, Beer, Wine & Spirits, Fruits & Veggies, Chinese, Food, Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt, Desserts, Seafood, Health Markets, Bagels, Cheese Shops, Shopping Centers, Chocolatiers & Shops, Meat Shops, Public Markets, Food Court, Wineries, Local Flavor, Ethnic Food, Restaurants, Specialty Food, Arts & Entertainment, Juice Bars & Smoothies, Seafood Markets, Farmers Market, Coffee & Tea, Bakeries, Food Stands, Dinner Theater, Sporting Goods, Grocery, Fashion",0.2883533473028154,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,Reading Terminal Market,19107,Center,0.2883533473028154,0.9977,0.2883533473028154

I have been here many times for their noodles, and they have never disappointed. Recently, I ordered the peanut noodles, egg tomato noodles, and the braised sliced beef noodle soup. These three dishes complimented each other really well with the varying flavors and noodle textures.  For takeout, you have the option to keep noodles and soups separated so the noodles keep their texture. 

Peanut noodles: peanutty with a slight soy sauce flavor, the texture of the hand drawn noodles is great. This dish is even better with some chilli oil and vinegar. Make sure to ask for it if you're ordering takeout! For the price, you must get these! I always order with handdrawn noodles.

Egg tomato noodles: the sauce was very flavorful, with woodear and scallion as well. I like these with both the handdrawn and shaved noodles.

Braised sliced beef noodle soup: like all their noodle soups, very flavorful. This one was slightly spicy and came with radishes. Noodles came with shanghai choy and cilantro.

The place has that kind of well-deserved loyalty and reputation. 

We did a recent takeout order. If you haven't been there, they have a very good COVID compliant pickup arrangement. In fact, the riskiest thing is probably driving into and out of the fairly small parking lot. It is, however, very convenient.

We started with an order of pan fried dumplings (note, the printed menu does not specify, but these are meat dumplings), which were rated very high by a Deputy Yelper in the household. Eggplant in hot garlic sauce (not super-spicy, just right) was excellent with perfected cooked Asian eggplants. The Tofu in Black Bean sauce was a bit plain, but satisfying just the same - tofu with a fried-chewy texture, and the accompanying veggies perfectly al dente. Deputy Yelper described their Szechuan Pepper Basil Lamb as ""fabulous."" 

The really nice details: yes, brown rice. Also, if you want leftovers, their serving size sets you up very nicely. I'd say that the typical vegetable or poultry order ($12-$13) is really two adult servings. Some other entrees are priced a little higher, but this is a very affordable menu overall taking into account serving size. They included enough mustard, soy and duck sauce packets for small army, plus numerous teabags. Nice touch for a takeout order.

Also, do yourself a favor and add their Avocado Salad in your cart. It's a juicy yummy salad with basically a full avocado in it! Best part is it's so cheap.

However, I will say I'm not a huge fan of their other Chinese food. The chicken teriyaki with veggies and rice is always pretty good, but beware sometimes the chicken is dry.

I never had a bad experience and the food/service was always excellent in AC, so I expected no different from this location.

When I first arrived, I was relieved to see the semi-enclosed booths for the outdoor seating. I had made reservations in advance, so I figured my party would get one of these booths. INSTEAD, we were seated in the open-air on the sidewalk, which was quite cold and uncomfortable. Somehow it didn't sit right with me that we were paying the same price as the more comfortable patrons while being completely out in the elements, despite having a reservation. It was especially bothersome when other parties seated on the sidewalk were being offered to move into a booth. I just don't believe you should have to sit entirely outside if you made a reservation. That should be reserved for last minute walk-in's.

The service also left much to be desired for. I do empathize with the difficulties of serving tables during COVID with outdoor dining, but our server first dropped my boyfriend's beer and promised to bring another free of charge, which took at least 30 minutes. Meanwhile, he was favoring other tables and giving them better service. It almost seemed like he was ignoring us and didn't even come back to check with us. After we'd already FINISHED our entrees, he told us ""your dinner will be out shortly"" which speaks volumes on his lack of awareness of our needs. I did want to order dessert and another drink, but everything was taking so long that I didn't even want to bother and by that point, we just wanted to get out of there.

Big menu with easy online ordering. Lots of delicious options that run the gamut of usual Chinese food as well as random specialties that I haven't seen elsewhere. Ordered the food and it was ready in a jiff which was great. 

Had the pan fried pork dumplings which were nice and crispy on the outside and delicious on the inside. The dipping sauce was a bit bitter for my taste but good regardless. Got the wonton soup which was an unfortunate occurrence. Several of the soups say ""Contains Pork,"" or ""Contains Shrimp."" The one I ordered didn't say anything, including what was inside I suppose. I specifically wrote ""Allergic to shellfish"" in the comments section but sure enough, they were full of shrimp. My friend was therefore unable to eat them, so I had the joy of finishing them. Delicious again with a good helping of wontons. I just wish they had read the comments, or explained things better on the website. For entrees with had Snow Pea Leaves with Garlic which were fantastic! A huge helping, nice and tender, and full of flavor. Also had the chicken with string beans which again was excellent. Not too oily or heavy. A nice sauce to go on the rice which was great and the string beans were perfectly cooked.

We put the meats in zip lock bags for freezing, then decided to weigh them as they felt lighter than expected.

The restaurant had a very young and vibrant environment. The seats had their own outlets, and there was a conveyor belt with a variety of small dishes/ingredients for your hotpot.

Service: We had made a reservation before arriving at Chubby Cattle. Since we arrived early, we had to wait about another 40 minutes. The staff was kind enough to give us a coupon for a free choice of meat. From the online reservation to being seated, it took a total of 1 hour and 40 minutes (on a Friday night). We definitely liked the online waitlist and would recommend signing up early as possible! The service was friendly and helped us explain their menu/portions. 

Food: We first ordered the House Original and House Hellist Spicy Pot (entry level spicy) as our soup bases. We loved that we could design our own hot pot sauce from a wide range of ingredients! From the conveyor belt, we got seaweed salad and rice cakes, and we also ordered udon noodles to enjoy with our soup. For our meats, we ordered the Beef Combo, which includes brisket, angus prime ribeye, and Australian Wagyu short rib, and got a pork belly from the coupon we got earlier. Overall the food was fantastic! However, we preferred the House Original over the Spicy because it paired better with the meats and udon noodles. While the conveyor belt has some nice selections, meat is definitely the way to go (we especially recommend the pork and ribeye, which was very soft!).

The food is always fresh with good portion sizes for the price. It also comes quickly. Avoid the egg rolls though they are quite greasy.

Update 1/7/20
Ordered my usual and a few others:
Let's break this down

Tempura appetizer- weird, bland mixture of very long fried shrimp, and veggies.
Edamame- overcooked, hard, dry, not edible. I threw it away. 
California roll- avocado was not fresh, overall tasted bad but i managed to eat after drowning in spicy mayo 
House fried rice- tasted odd, onions undercooked but might be salvageable if i add soy sauce and mirin.

I'm a little upset. I'll probably think twice about ordering again.

Obviously the food is tapas style, and we didn't regret ordering any of our plates. As a pescatarian, I especially recommend the salmon skewers (so very flavorful) and shrimp pad Thai! The Brussel sprouts are consistently the star of the show, too. Thanks Sampan for all that you do!

UPDATE (visited again for happy hour):

Sampan's happy hour absolutely broke the 5-star scale for me. Can I give it at least 6 stars?? I was blown away by how much high quality food & drink we got for such a reasonable price. A huge bowl of fried rice for only $5?  You must be pulling my leg! The scorpion bowls are phenomenal and the right amount alcoholic for a lil evening fun!

First you pick your soup base, there are several choices. I went with the entry level hot. Next you pick your protein. Wagyu beef is available at multiple price levels, (from F! To WTF!) alongside a few other choices. You are also presented with a basket of ingtedients to make your own dipping sauce - garlic, fresh ground chiles, scallions, etc. While your soup simmers in front of you, a refrigerated conveyor belt that runs past every table provides a parade of ingredients you can grab - vegetables, Tofu, seafood, raw eggs, more. Every color coded plate has a different price. We figured out how to poach the eggs in our soup ladles, really changed the flavor of the soup in a positive way.  Be careful with the ""sponge tofu"", if this soaked in your spicy broth it will deliver a blast of hot temperature AND hot spicy broth directly to the back of your throat.

Pros: Tasted good, not bad for $11
Cons: Ordinary 

PASSION FRUIT LEMONADE:    8/10
Pros: Tasted good
Cons: Plain, nothing to see here keep it moving

TUNA PIZZA:    10/10
Pros: Appetizing, colorful dish, the garnishing made it pop. I would recommend this dish.
Cons: Was it worth $17? That's up for debate

DIM SUM SAMPLER: 9/10
Pros: Tasty af. Sechuan pork & edamame dumplings were the best of the bunch. Put that chilli soy dipping sauce wit'em to take it up a notch.
Cons: $21 for 8 pieces hmmm that's tough

CRAB FRIED RICE: 8/10
Pros: Scrumptious, has an escargots tinge taste to it. 
Cons: Portion size lacking for the price. Meal was forgettable.

KOREAN BEEF FRIED RICE: 9/10
Pros: An inviting dish. Garnishing game was on point. The sunny side up egg was a good compliment. Well seasoned, tasted great.
Cons: Nothing I could think of.


BBQ PORK TENDERLOIN: 9/10
Pros: Very delicious, savory af. The green sauce across the meat was a good touch. I think the onion ring that came with it was the crunchiest onion ring I ever had. Another recommendation in my book.

Now, I haven't been to a lot of public markets like this, and more memorable ones for me have bee in Australia (such as the night market in Cairns and the Queen Victoria Market in Melbourne).  Some of the domestic ones, like Quincy Market and Boston Market, seems very touristy.  To be certain, Reading Terminal attracts its fair share of out-of-towners like us, but unlike Quincy Market there's still a sense that it's a place where locals come.  Maybe I'm wrong about that, but as compared to our subsequent experience in Boston just a week later, Reading Terminal was far less crowded, though still bustling with activity.

There are so many good things to eat here, and I wish I could remember all of the places we visited to get little bites here and there.  Cannoli, poutine, a big ol' freshly baked biscuit with jam, fresh fruit from the grocer, a pastry called a pig ear, and much more - all of it was good.  I wish we had more time to eat our way through the entire market.  There's so much variety, and overall prices were quite reasonable, at least when it comes to the little snacks that we were picking up at every other stall.

We weirdly had fond memories of the Buddakan's chocolate sorbet , so we put it on our list for our return visit.

Working backwards, the chocolate sorbet is still really good and probably the best part of our meal. We should have ordered less food and ordered two sorbets instead of sharing one serving at the end :-/

For our main course, we had the barbeque lamb chops and lobster fried rice. We started with the  tuna tartare spring rolls, pork, and shrimp dumplings. To summarize, the food I would rank it comparatively to a PF Chang's restaurant. Nothing was inedible, but it was all forgettable (except for the chocolate sorbet ;- ) ).  To be fair, the cilantro salad (served with the lamb chops) had a nice kick. Frankly, we would have been more satisfied with a double serving of the cilantro salad, instead of something else.

For drinks, we had a peach lemonade, Szechuan sour, and glass of shiraz. All were fine, but once again, not terribly memorable.

Our server worked very hard and was attentive. She was aware of our lactose allergy and mentioned it as we were seated, which is better than the Michelin star restaurant we dined at two nights ago! Therefore, we have no criticisms of the service.

The total price for the dinner including tax, tip and a 20+% tip for our server was $213. The bottom line of trading off quality with price is that it just wasn't a great value for us.

It's a cozy space so when we went for breakfast on a Saturday morning all the tables were taken - we were prepared to wait, but they cleared off a table just so we could sit right away!! (At this point, my heart was already full.)

I had never had siphon coffee before, so the owner's son (we never got his name but with my creepy detective skills, I think his name is Lawrence) told us all about how the process works while we watched him brew it right in front of us (it looks like a chemistry experiment!). I got the sumiyaki and my friend got the Jamaican blue coffee and Lawrence gave us the extras from both so that we could try each other's. Looking at the coffee, you can tell it's going to be the smoothest coffee you've ever had. I'm not even a regular coffee drinker, and when I do I usually have a latte, but I was able to drink the siphon coffee black (probably because it was also accompanied by a cute little chocolate-dipped shortbread cookie that is from the same Greek place they've been getting them from for the last 30 years). It's pricey but well worth it!

We also ordered the beef tomato rice which was like tomato egg rice (the ultimate classic Chinese comfort food) with corn/peas/carrots, beef, and ketchup. So so cozy. We also got the popular dumpling sampler; they were all plump and juicy and everything I wanted.

There was delicious homemade chili oil as well, which is a labor of love by Lawrence's brother who grinds the peppers himself and has to arm himself with goggles/gloves when he makes it. You can take some home for about $4 a container - do it and thank me later.

My friend and I were enjoying our morning slowly so by the end of the meal we had talked to Lawrence quite a bit. After we got the check he even gave us a slice of the cheesecake (I LOVE cheesecake so to say I was excited is an understatement) which was accompanied by coffee jelly and espresso beans. The cheesecake was smooth, creamy, and not too sweet. It was made by his brother who came up with a recipe from lots of Youtube research and taste testing by a friend who is also a cheesecake aficionado. 

The hospitality I experienced here reminded me of why I love Philly so much, and you can see how much pride the Ray family has in their cafe and how much care and intentionality was involved in the food/drinks from beginning to end (even in selecting the dishes/utensils).

Edamame Dumpling - Average. I've had better dumpling from the frozen foods section at the Asian Supermarket.

Spicy Tuna Roll - Your average spicy tuna roll that's available at any sushi restaurant.

Pork Bao - Overcooked, overly salty meat. Bao was dry. 

Crispy Brussel Sprout - Tasty! Probably my favorite dish out of what we ordered.

Chicken Tikka Satay - The menu says it comes with yogurt, which was not brought out. The order comes with ONE stick of dry, under-seasoned chicken. 

General Tso Soup Dumpling - Think of a soup dumpling, but half its size, with a sprinkle of general tso flavor on it. 

Hamachi Ceviche - Delicious, but extremely small serving size.

Really fresh ingredients all around - we got both the beef combo and the seafood combo, and was impressed by the quality. The seafood platter even came out with an ice sculpture!

We also ordered two servings of the noodles - very colorful, I think the flavors were purple yam, a vegetable one, and something else. We ordered a couple more things and the bill came to $50/pp ($200 total including tip, split between 4 people). To be honest I could have probably eaten a lot more because the food was so yummy, but we wanted bubble tea for dessert so I disciplined myself to stop. Plus, $50/pp is not cheap when the other hot pot we've had before averaged around $30/pp.

Our waitress was very helpful in giving us guidance on what to order, and kept us updated on the progress of our food coming out if we had been waiting for awhile. We ordered the heaven/hell hot pot with the tomato oxtail broth and the entry-level spicy (not spicy at all in my opinion but the 3 friends I was with said it was spicy enough for them).

The food was good, pricey, yes, but very good. And it was beautifully plated to give off a ""wow"" factor for a few of the dishes. 

And it was pretty high quality!  Ingredients such as the steak were fresh and well-prepared, with ""medium"" being a true ""medium,"" no more and no less. 

The two things I enjoyed most about Buddakan were the ambiance - it was a great environment to eat, mingle, and have fun - not too pretentious, but just upscale enough and the diversity of food choices - menu items ranged from the low $10s to $40-$50 depending on what you ordered, so you could get away with just doing small plates and not breaking the bank. 

I heard somewhere that this was the first Buddakan (feel free to fact check me) before they moved onto NYC (Chelsea market?) and my experience here confirmed that the food scene in Philadelphia truly punches above its weight. Not too pricey, extremely high quality. 

Finally, our server introduced herself and was pleasant and polite. Very knowledgeable and not too obtrusive.

I enjoy the history, the variety of shoppes, and the whole atmosphere of this marketplace. I can see why Reading Terminal Market has been in business for so long. Some of my favourite spots here are the tea shoppe, the beeswax candle shoppe, the General Store, the Mushroom shoppe, and Flying Monkey for their gluten free options. As a New Yorker I come here to stock up on items I cannot find near me, and it's also significantly more affordable. 

My only advice is to not visit during the Philadelphia Flower Show, because that's when the Market gets mobbed with tourists! This is especially true about the Donut Shoppe-my first visit to the Flower Show back in 2015, and my first trip to Philly. All I wanted to do was explore the Market, but there was a long line, a good kilometer (0.6 mile), wrapped around the outside of the building! Why? 'Cuz tourists wanted those famous donuts, that's why! XD:   But that's good for business so I'm not complaining 'bout that!

The server mistakenly brought us chive dumplings instead of cabbage since she might have misheard me, but I like them too and honestly didn't mind. Service was otherwise fast and effective, but not overly friendly as expected at a Chinese spot. 

The chive dumplings were plump and had nice chewy homemade wraps, and the pan-fried dumplings were super juicy. The soup dumplings more of the traditional style from what I know, being bigger and thicker-skinned than the little fancy Din Tai Fung style. I find that makes them easier to pick up without breaking, and the soup inside was thick and meaty. Overall it was an affordable and filling meal, though if my stomach had more room I would've ordered a veggie dish to balance out all the carbs and meat.

I've been craving dim sum for awhile and didn't feel like eating outside in the cold. This was our first time here and I loved the selection of dim sum on the menu. They even had a page just for vegan options which my vegan + vegetarian friend really appreciated :)
We came in for lunch and it wasn't that busy so we felt very safe. The staff wore masks and glasses and took down our order. The only disappointing thing was that some of the items on the menu I wanted to try they didn't have but it's fine!! There was so many things we got instead.
We got a variety of items from shrimp shumai, pork/shrimp shumai, pork+crab soup dumplings, pan fried pork soup dumplings, scallion pancakes, vegetable steamed dumplings, crystal shrimp dumplings, pork belly + mustard greens and vegetable tofu soup. 
My favs were both the shumais! Both were stuffed with pork and shrimp and were juicy/delicious. I did like the pork and shrimp soup dumplings but the broth wasn't as flavorful as I would like. Scallion pancakes were nice and flaky (yum!). The pan fried pork soup dumplings were okay I didn't like how it was doughy but it tasted good inside.

COVID setup is great outside. One use menus, everyone was wearing masks and the warmth was quite reasonable in the outdoor cubicles. 

Pretty big menu which made it a bit hard to decide, but something for everyone with lots of staple Chinese dishes. We had two carafes of sake for drinks. Would have been nice to have warm sake in the cold weather but that wasn't an option. We had pork soup dumplings and vegetarian dumplings for an appetizer. Delicious and served quickly with a nice sauce on the side. We ordered about 7 dishes total and we asked them to come out as they were ready but in retrospect that was a mistake. Things came out very quickly and filled up the table. Especially in the cold weather this made things a bit cold, so make sure you tell them to bring them out slowly. 

Dan Dan noodles were excellent as well. Not too spicy but still with a nice kick of flavor. Also had pork belly with mustard greens which came with some bok choy as well. Meat was delicious and tender and came with supplies to make little bao buns which were nice. Eggs and tomatoes were simple and well done as was the garlic eggplant. Last was the snow pea leaves which were again, very simply but done very well.

The part that got me was that the food was so salty and there was a lot of rice. When I bite into the roll, it's just... rice. A good roll should have a nice ratio of rice and sauce and crunch (none of these had crunch even though the description mentions crunch) and fish. I was extremely full eating half of my order but just from... rice. 

Another thing that bothered me was that I LOVE wasabi. I eat as much wasabi as a Japanese person probably. I like to have at least a tip of a chopstick amount of wasabi per sushi roll, but when I got my order, I received a LOT of soy sauce but only about 2 bean size amounts of wasabi (if you look at my photos, you can barely see the wasabi). It's one thing to give too much, but to barely have enough wasabi for my order was disappointing. 

On top of it all, these rolls aren't cheap. I got 3 rolls for $42 on Grubhub. For the price I pay, I expect better quality. And I've eaten a lot of sushi in my life so when I don't like something that means I really don't like it. 

The reason I give 3 stars is because the overall flavors are ok and they're quick with my order. But the biggest factors that make it a 3 and not a 4 or 5 are mentioned above. 

Would I come here again? It's hard to say. Was this just a bad day for them? Was their original chef somewhere else?

If you're looking for savory and authentic Chinese noodles at a very reasonable price, definitely get Nan Zhou.

We ordered the
Szechuan Cold Noodle with Original Hand-Pulled Style noodles
Noodle with Peanut Sauce with Original Hand-Pulled Style noodles
Tomato with Egg on Noodles with Shaved Style noodles

These dishes definitely gave us a good variety of flavor, and the portions are fantastic;  You can't go wrong with these dishes -- especially if you add their chili oil. The noodle texture in all dishes were perfect; the hand-pulled noodles are very long and have a good, springy bite. The shaved style noodles are thick and chewy and go great with the tomato egg and some of their soups.

Dim Sum Garden is a great place for foodies looking to dip their toes in Chinese cuisine. The menu and English-speaking staff make it much more approachable than other authentic establishments in the area and is a huge haven for those who don't speak Cantonese or Mandarin but, would really like some dim sum. As a Chinese American and someone who grew up on dim sum, the quality and flavor of the food was nowhere near the caliber of any of the dim sum establishments nearby.  The food had little to no seasoning and the prices were far greater than they should be. The only thing on the menu that I think is okay is the soup dumplings; everything else is better elsewhere.

It's also important to note that this establishment does not follow CDC guidelines.

Before we get into specific dishes, my feedback overall is: if you are used to spicy food / if you order 8-10 at Han, make sure you specify you want spicy. The food was DELICIOUS and it had great  Szechuan peppercorn / chili oil flavoring, but I would have liked everything a bit spicer. I didn't specify any spice level as I wanted to try as-is for my first time. 

Must order:
Dan Dan - really great flavor. The noodles are much thinner than what I'm used to from other dan dan recipes, and it's a totally different flavor. Less nutty flavored and more Szechuan peppercorn. Really delicious. 

Cumin Beef - My fiance got this and I was only allowed to steal one bite because he enjoyed it so much. The beef seems to be seared / dry fried in a delicious cumin flavoring. I usually get cumin chicken and I might be a convert to cumin beef moving forward. Very flavorful + great portion! 

Thinly sliced beef in hot & spicy sauce - ( This is a similar dish to the Hot Sauce Beef from han, just with a different name). This is what I ordered and first off the portions are HUGE - I got THREE meals out of this. It came piping hot that I burnt my entire tongue off- just the way I like it! Now the flavor profile...was so, so amazing. Tons of raw garlic and napa cabbage and meat in the most delicious sauce. It had that lovely numbing effect that I love about Szechuan Peppercorns. I enjoyed every bite, of all 3 meals I got from this.  The only thing I didn't love was it came with a big pile of cilantro stems + leaves on top (not a big cilantro fan) but luckily I was able to remove the whole pile easily before diving in. 

If you want steamed rice for either entree dish it costs extra, which I also thought was odd, but it was only $1. 

Hot & Sour Soup - This was the best hot & sour soup I've had. And it was only $2. I will be dreaming of this soup for days to come.  

As for the restaurant ambiance, the place is so clean, cute, and classy! I loved the teapot, tea cups, & complimentary Green tea itself, and loved the whole feng shui of the dining area. The service was stellar & everyone was so nice as well!

Albeit, I have not tried that many places, but if there were something better I am sure I would have heard about it by now. You cannot go wrong with this place as the food is delicious and the prices are more than reasonable. 

Food 4.5/5: our group ordered the vegetable dumplings, the Mapo Tofu, and the vegetable Bao. These three items packed a punch of flavor and authenticity that cannot be put into words. We were hoping that the food would be a little more spicy as we enjoy the spice, however they were able to give us some sriracha on the side to help with that. The reason why it doesn't get a 5/5 is because we had also ordered bubble tea, which you should avoid at this location. The bubble tea did not taste as good as we had hoped and they forget to include the tapioca pearls (but they re-made it for us and included it the second time). For vegetarians, this is a good spot because of the numerous options that they have. 

Service 5/5
The service is also great  as we came at noon on a Thursday. Therefore, we didn't have to wait and we were able to seat ourselves inside. You can tell the staff work very hard because they were constantly moving around bringing food and water to different tables. Our server was great, we did not catch his name however. 

Ambience 3/5
Honestly, not much to say for ambience. Beside for the Asian food and the chopsticks, I couldn't tell I was in an Asian restaurant. It was clean and quite so I cannot complain. The bathrooms are kept tidy, but not perfectly clean. 

Tips:

The scallion pancakes are really good. They have a chewier texture than most and that's something that I like. 
I've tried the steamed sliced pork belly with with Chinese pickle and it blew me away. The pork was so tender and the flavor was incredible. I probably would not have picked that off the menu but my friend wanted to try and it was a good call! 
The cold chicken with bone in spicy sauce is nice and spicy. A lot of chili oil in that dish that I  saved and used for other things because I couldn't let that deliciousness go to waste. 
The chongqing chicken is probably the best I've had. Crispy and spicy. Lots of red peppers but more chicken than peppers which is nice. A lot of times when you order that dish from other restaurants it's deceiving because the portion ends up being mostly peppers. 
I got the sister dish to that which is the fried fish fillet with dry red pepper. This was also amazing, but I probably prefer the chicken. 
They also have American Chinese food as well. I must admit, I love sweet and sour pork. I cant help it! Sometimes I  just get a craving and I did get it from here and it was exactly what I needed.

If you're looking for a decent all you can get hotpot and/or kbbq place for a good value in Philly Chinatown, this place for you! They have a large selection of meat, seafood, vegetables, and noodles that you can get for both, though I think the selection for hotpot is larger and better than Kbbq. You use your phone to scan the QR code to get the list of all ingredients you can get and just tell the waiter whatever you want, and of course you can order as you go as well. 

*DINNER*
Hotpot - I've had their kimchi broth, original broth, and tomato broth, and so far, my favorite is the tomato (sweet, savory, and sour). I love their selection of fishballs and seafood (they even have crab!) Their meat is fresh, did not come out frozen unlike other places I've been, lean and not as fat (though personally, I prefer fattier cuts). I don't think you can really go wrong with hotpot.

Kbbq - Their selection is a bit more limited than Kbbq, but definitely have the classic bulgogi, galbi, pork belly, as well as unique meats like duck and pork chop. The meats was fresh. Personally I wasn't the biggest fan of bbq because I think the seasoning were all the same. Plus the meat like pork belly were all thinly sliced and i prefer thicker pieces for fattier meats like that.

The food was pretty good. The first thing we got were the dumplings. The dumpling filling itself seems like pork and was alright. Could've done with tiny but more seasoning and something like chives would've been nice. That chili oil it was in was amazing though. It gave a nice amount of heat with a hint of sweetness to cut through it all. Absolutely delicious chili oil.

The Taiwanese pork belly burger (on a lotus bun) left me a little mixed. The pork belly was bursting with flavorful and paired well with the garnishes. The crumbled peanuts didn't feel like it added too much, maybe if they were roasted peanuts it might have been better. The main reason I had some reservations on this dish was because of the bun. Usually they are soft and airy, but this one was a bit tough. If the bun was better this dish would have been amazing!!

The dry pepper chicken was pretty good. It wasn't as spicy as I thought it would be and less spicy than the noodles we got. The chicken was super crispy and absorbs the flavors really well. It does get a bit too overwhelming with the saltiness the more you eat.

The noodles were pretty good. The sliced braised beef shined on top of this mountain of long noodles. Every bite into the soft braised beef bursted with flavor. I only wish the noodles were slightly shorter or cut in half cause they are really long and could be a bit messy if you slip. The chili oil that these noodles are in was alright.

It's definitely a COVID-safe experience.

We both ordered the Maki Combo which came with soup and salad - the soup was the best we'd had from any place we've gotten sushi - it had a healthy amount of tofu and seaweed. He ordered the crunchy spicy salmon, spicy crunchy tuna, and the screaming 1. He really liked the crunchy spicy tuna and salmon; he wasn't as big of a fan of the screaming 1 as the avocado was overwhelming. I ordered the crunchy spicy salmon, salmon avocado, and screaming 2. I really enjoyed the crunch spicy salmon but not as much the others with avocado - the avocado was overwhelming; next time I'll probably stick with the crunch spicy rolls.

The cuisine is an Americanized Chinese-Japanese-Korean fusion, offering items such as dumplings, tuna sashimi pizza, calamari salad, bibimbap, black pepper beef, pan-seared sea bass, spare ribs, and more. The black pepper beef was by far my favorite with tender beef chunks in a sweet and savory sauce. The other items we tried were ok but not remarkable.

We are outdoors on the sidewalk which was perfect for a day with good weather. The indoor dining feels more upscale, with dim lighting and a giant golden Buddha statue overshadowing the main room. The service was friendly and prompt.

Beef noodle soup is a relatively simple dish without any crazy toppings or spices (unless you order the one spicy version), with a deeply meaty broth and chewy handmade noodles. No sucker punches or fancy colors here, just a warm hug in your belly. Beef noodle soup is literally served as fast food in China, and I wish there was a Nan Zhou type place in every neighborhood over here!

For every noodle dish, you're offered the choice between hand-drawn (thinner and ramen-like) or shaved (broad and fat like chow fun) noodles; everyone I know has their preference but I ALWAYS get hand-drawn. I used to get literally the simplest of the soups - sliced beef noodle soup - but now go for the House Special soup that comes with a variety of meats, including some remarkably delicious meatballs. On hotter days, the Szechuan and Sesame Cold Noodles are more refreshing and feature the same yummy noodles. The signature noodle dishes are big and affordable, but if you somehow have more room, the dumplings and pig ears (spicy, chewy, and meaty) are great appetizers to share.

For a homely Chinatown spot, the dining area is actually quite nice and spacious. However, as a homely Chinatown spot, they only take cash and more recently Venmo (though you might need to get up to ask to Venmo), so come prepared.

The two hidden gems here are the salty tofu soup and the sticky rice. The salty tofu has a silky pudding-like texture similar to Korean soondoobu, but only optionally spicy. Give it a good stir to spread out the salty dried shrimp, and get some fried dough or youtiao (literally a fat stick of deep-fried dough, like a sugarless churro) to dip and eat along with it. The sticky rice as they call it here (but also known as Chinese tamale, rice dumpling, and zongzi) is a chunk of, well, flavored sticky rice tightly wrapped in a bamboo leaf and encasing one of several fillings. I personally like the Shanghai-style meat filling with fatty pork, though I wish it also had nuts or beans like I've had it elsewhere to liven up the texture and that it was served hot. The small space makes this place better for takeout anyway, so just throw it in the microwave at home.

Perhaps a little more well-known are the steamed buns, and while the roast pork or char siu buns seem to be the most recognized kind in the States, I actually find the ones here to be lacking in meat. On the other hand, I LOVE both the pork, egg, and sausage buns and the pork and vegetable buns, which are more generously filled and closer to the Northern Chinese food I grew up eating. I haven't really had the sweet items here, but given the place's name, I don't doubt that they're good.

I live in the neighborhood and noticed it being readied for opening so came for dinner on their 6th day of operation.  It was one of the best meals I've had in ages!  It reminded me of Susanna Foo that used to be on Walnut Street - without the snooty attitude and at 1/3 the cost!

The menu but especially the daily specials are incredibly extensive, from vegetarian to seafood to meat and poultry.  Everything sounded fabulous and interesting.  Our group of 4 shared 2 sampler appetizer platters (Seafood and Vegetarian), and they were delicious.  Each with a selection of 4 perfectly prepared, beautifully presented appetizers that were complete creations themselves.  For dinners our table enjoyed the seafood curry medley, a tofu dish, crispy chicken, and everything was excellent.  Rich flavors, well balanced, interesting, perfectly prepared and presented.  Creme brulee for desert was excellent.  Appropriate sized portions (I have had too much experience with ""fine dining"" where the food is so precious and portions so small I leave only half-full).  As I said, one of the most delicious meals I've had in ages!   

We ate outside on the sidewalk because it was a nice evening, which at the corner of South & Juniper was fine, but they say they will soon have a deck in the back for outdoor dining.  Service was very nice and did not have the usual hiccups of a new restaurant.  Staff and particularly the owner Corey were great, and it is clear he really enjoys hosting people and pleasing them with his skills.  It took a long time for the food to be ready, so this is not fast in-and-out, not surprising given the extensive menu offerings.  No liquor license so BYOB.

Finally, you can't beat the price.  Appetizers, dinners, shared desert with tax & tip came to $40pp.  Given the quality of the food, it can't stay at that level for long and be a profit-making restaurant, but while it does it is an incredible bargain!

We got there and got seated right away! I was surprised at how packed it was for 10 pm. Definitely a great night life atmosphere! 
Our waiter was very nice and made sure we had everything we needed.
My boyfriend and I got the dim sum sampler. You need to try it!! We couldn't decide which appetizer to get so decided to do a taste test and they were DELICIOUS! 
The 4 of us got a pitcher to split (I forget the drink name) which was very tasty! However, expensive and only filled us up each with about 1 1/2 glasses.
For entrees I got the pad thai. Holy crap- amazing!!!! It was so good and well worth the price.

We got four items: shrimp tostada, fish tacos, wontons, and baby corn. Every single one of them tasted off to us- the tostada was totally overwhelmed by bland refried black beans with basically no other flavor, I didn't taste the fish tacos but my partner said they were extremely salty. The wontons were... I mean, they were fried wontons, I'm not complaining about the concept, but the salsas they were served with all had off flavors and very minimal spice, and... last but not least... the baby corn. Why, just... why. Nothing about those flavors made any sense, it was extremely salty and was not at all palatable. And all together with a Topo Chico it cost $87 (That's including tip, but still) Just... save yourself the trouble, unless you are just going to hang out and drink there and don't care about the food. Would maybe be less noticeable if we were drunk. For context, I can't remember the last time I didn't like any of the food items I ordered at a restaurant, if ever. This is a restaurant that exists to be instagramable and sell drinks - if you are looking for good food or even in the ballpark of a reasonable price for the quality, look elsewhere. 

Good things were the drink I got (grapefruit and smoked sea salt) and the server and host staff were very friendly, helpful and doing an excellent job.

There's a lot of good Asian food in Houston, but it's mostly Vietnamese, or Vietnamese-influenced Chinese, or, stranger yet, Vietnamese versions of American Chinese food (or even Vietnamese-American Chinese-Mexican smash-ups).  But in Philly it's different, unlike anything I've had anywhere else.  So every time I come here I make the rounds of the Chinese restaurants.

I come to this one, like others do, for the Braised Beef Soup. I like it spicy, which has a little less heat than regular Buffalo wings.  The noodles are excellent. The broth is kind of bland compared to pho, but the braised beef compensates for the lack of flavor in the broth. I think the beef is brisket, and the good fatty kind that Texans love to smoke for hours in their smokers, until it melts in your mouth. Here it also melts in your mouth, releasing a cacophony of chili oil and spices as you savor the meat.  For each bite I like a to twirl some noodles (yes, I use a fork), get a small piece of beef, then capture a few herbs.  Sometime I need to to get past the soup and see if they have stir-fried noodles with braised beef.

This was my second time here, and, like the first time, there was a line out the door at the adjacent dim sum joint.  But, also like the first time, there were plenty of seats available in the tiny, sterile space so I was seated right away.  The tables are jammed together, with tables-for-four spaced about an inch from the tables-for-two, and, even if the restaurant is nearly empty, they always seat one party adjacent to another. It's almost as if you're all dining at the same table.  Some folk like that, I guess.

I couldn't find the braised beef soup on the menu. I flipped back-and-forth, looked on the back, and still couldn't find it. The waiter came to take my order, and I asked him, in panic mode, if they still had the braised beef soup. They did.  The pages of the menu were sticking together, and I was skipping the entire middle part.  

I wanted something in my stomach to avoid eating all the  carb-heavy, delicious noodles, so I ordered the diced cucumber.  The dish was a cucumber salad with lots of salt and chopped garlic, a sprinkle of cilantro, and a slice of a scallion. It was refreshing; I think I'll make this at home, but with more cilantro and scallion.

Besides the crowdedness, the only other downside to Nan's is that they don't take credit cards. If the soup were priced a few dollars less, I could understand that, but it's not.

Yes we started sweating buckets from the hot and mildly spicy soup on a summer day... and it was worth it!!

We had the lamb soup yummmm good chunks of meat on those bones and flavorful lamb taste even through the spicy stock!! And they didn't skimp on the veggies either

I heard about the long wait times, especially on a Friday night, but I didn't expect to be 14th in line despite waitlisting an hour early. Try going early despite having waitlisted as they told us a shorter wait time than what was indicated on Yelp.

The service was phenomenal, honestly the best I have ever seen. The young lady who welcomed us was friendly and patient and held our spot for us even though we walked off for a bit during our wait time.

Our server was just as friendly and sweet. You can choose to order through the conveyor (it's cheaper, more for 1 person) or through their menu (bigger portions, more expensive). I had the House Original Pot and my boyfriend got the Tomato Oxtail Pot. We both argue our own is better.

The hot pot ingredients are extremely overpriced, and I'm talking $1 for one mini sausage. However, their soup does wonders in making any food taste phenomenal. I barely even needed sauce, although their ponzu sauce was delightful. 

The Wagyu Beef w/ Wasabi ($12) was expensive for the small stick size, but it was oh so good and full of beef aroma.

Even in the morning on a weekday, people were piling in here. The menu variety is ABUNDANT. If we didn't have our minds set on roast duck, I would have had trouble deciding. We ordered a Mixed Variety Fried Dumplings ($9.50) for an appetizer in addition to Roast Duck Noodles ($9.50).

Wait, I just realized the Mixed Variety Fried Dumplings cost the same amount as the entree. I wouldn't say they were worth that price but they were good! Despite being called fried, they were very dough-y. The delicious oily meat juice pours out as soon as you bite into one. I particularly enjoyed the beef tasting one. 

The Roast Duck Noodles hit the spot. Their hand drawn noodles and broth wasn't as great as the ones in NYC, but I appreciate how their noodles didn't arrive clumped together. Also, their DUCK. They gave us plenty of pieces, with my boyfriend even getting the drumstick. The portion sizes were also huge.

The host was very friendly and we were seated immediately. He also turned out to be our waiter and he was very attentive. The dining area was sizable and clean, but the decor was a bit dated. We also noticed right away that we were bringing down the median age significantly. Customer clientele seemed to be mostly elderly, with the occasional older businessman. Not a big deal of the food is good.

Their lunch menu was reasonably priced for the area with a mixture of appetizers, rice and pasta dishes, soups, salads, and main courses. The food came out so fast, it couldn't of been more than 5ish minutes after we ordered. So I guess that's a huge plus if you are stopping by on your limited lunch hour.

I ordered the Wok Lamb and Chinese Eggplant (lamb with Chinese eggplant and scallions in a black bean sauce) with brown rice. While a bit one note as far as color (with a tiny bit of purple trying to pop through), the flavor was good. The lamb was cooked well as was the Chinese eggplant. The black bean sauce had nice Unami flavor. The rice was pretty bland.

My friend got the Pad Thai with Jumbo Shrimp (basil, vegetables and crushed peanuts in a spicy squid sauce). The shrimp were impressively large, but my friend commented that it was in her opinion too spicy, so only order this if you like a little kick. I bet I would of liked it.

My husband got the Szechuan Sesame Chicken (Sliced white meat chicken with sesame and peanut butter sauce). This was a unique interpretation, and probably healthier, on the traditional sesame chicken. The chicken isn't fried and uses peanut sauce so not as sweet. I had a bite and while I like the OG way, this was also very good. 

At the end they give you a fortune cookie, but for a yummy twist, they dip them in chocolate. I am not usually a fan of a fortune cookie flavor, but this upped the anty a lot.

Based on some inaccurate information from Google, friends and I arrived at DSG at 10:30 on a Saturday morning expecting to be the first ones in the door. To our surprise, they open at 11 AM. We walked around for a bit, got coffee, wasted time and by 10:50 there was a long line down the block, full of patrons waiting to get inside. This is when I realize that my friends and I were not unique for craving some soup dumplings and noodles for brunch on a Saturday morning. 

I think it's extremely important to note that you come to DSG for delicious food. This is a fast, casual environment. While there are servers that take your order and check-in, this is not a place to expect a fine dining experience with white glove service. If you manage those expectations, there is no reason to have a bad experience at DSG because the price point for the food you get is a great value. 

Our party of four ordered chicken on a stick, stewed chicken noodle, chicken fried rice, cucumber salad, and two orders of pork soup dumplings. Things came out within 15 minutes of placing our order. I've been a long time take-out only patron of DSG, but the dine-in experience is unmatched.

Chubby Cattle I think was one of the first restaurants to feature purely some sort of Hot Pot in Philly and it's still growing strong with lots of other hot pot places opening up. I really enjoyed coming here and those who want a good hot pot who are willing to expend a little bit of cash should definitely give this place a try!

Food/Drinks - Definitely very good quality. They have a huge assortment of meats, seafood, and veggies. What makes this place somewhat unique is it has a rotating conveyer belt that you can get lots of other hot pot ingredients from (other than the main meats). They are color-coded and at the end of your meal, the plates are tallied and that is how they calculate your price. You can also directly order from the server from the menu as well, though I've noticed it seems a bit more expensive. Despite this, you should still come eat here with the expectation that it won't be cheap. In regards to drinks, they are BYOB as of the last few months since their bar was closed. It is unclear when it will be open or if they will remain as BYOB. 

Environment - Great staff and very attentive. We had a server once that was extremely enthusiastic and kind of flamboyant, but funny. What is tough about this place is that there tends to be long waits and parking is atrocious unless you're going straight to a garage or you know the city enough to find hidden parking spots. Put your name down in line (can be done virtually via Yelp) and the estimated wait time is typically on point.

The decor, music, and theme was so unique and fun. My friends and I came here for happy hour and had a pretty good experience. I ordered the spiked agua Fresca, which was very refreshing and light. We all shared the fried wonton chips which were addicting. The three salsas all tasted great and it was a fun app. Nothing mind blowing but it was a unique twist to the traditional tortilla chips and salsa. I ordered the shrimp and black bean tostada, which all my friends agreed was the best thing on the table. Filling, fresh and delicious. The beer battered fish taco was good, but very fried. The mushroom taco was also good, but extremely greasy and left massive residue of straight grease. Get the black sesame flan! Not too sweet and very addicting! 

Two things I didn't love. No food on the happy hour menu. The waitress told us the happy hour special, which were wings for $14. Sounded more like special of the day because that does not sound like happy hour prices. At least lower the price for the wonton chips during happy hour. Only other thing was this restaurant was supposed to be Mexican/Chinese inspired. Not much Asian influences. Not sure how any of the tacos had Asian influences. I thought the flavors would be more of a fusion, but it's more of a fusion of concepts.

Some on the menu are good - such as the pork belly carbonara was well prepared and creative in using cured egg yolk (like many Chinese dishes use salt egg yolk), some are just okay - like the striped bass was little overcooked and tasted too char on the skin. Portion was not as standard for this price, but I don't complain for that. 

The service was definitely NOT as expected. We made a reservation for 3  at 5:15pm and we arrived around 5pm. When we were taken to their garden for seating and the table arranged for us was small and under the direct sunlight. So we asked our host to arrange a 6-people table under the umbrella, and said we should be done before another party came if the table is reserved. BESIDES, at the time, there was another 6-people table sat by a party of three young ladies. No offense to these lovely ladies, they all are WHITE ladies. Our host came back said they cannot let us sit any of the 6-people tables because reservations. However, by the time when we left around 7:15pm, none of the parties for these 6-people tables came. ALL these tables were empty for the entire time. So I wonder is it because our group does not appear to be white?

When we sat down at our small table, our waiter came to run down the specials for us and let us know that they can only take all orders at once because whatever ordered not at the 1st order of your table will come very very late. Okay, weird but that's fine. Then the waiter really diligently reminded us many times while we were there that we only have until 7:15pm to enjoy the meal, because they needed to get ready for next reservation. Okay, I get that and we always finish before whatever the ""allowable time"" is. BUT REALLY? Do you need to constantly let your guests feel they need to ""get out"" at certain time? Besides, by the time we left, there were tons of other tables empty in the place.

I get it. All the hip places like this have an attitude. But people dine out for a relaxing experience and to have a good time. I've been to many places and all the good places share the same thing -

This is my favorite restaurant in Chinatown thus far. If you're looking for delicious Sichuan food, you must go to this place. They are known for this fish pot which feeds a family, but their other entrees are just as good if not even better. I've been there handful of time and each time, everything was good. I have not been disappointed yet. Each dish is also large enough to feed at least 2-4 people, totally worth the price.

My favorite dishes:

Pickled cabbage pot with sliced fish - this is literally my comfort food. Sour cabbage was indeed sour enough to my liking. The soup was rich and deep in flavor, it was heavenly. They definitely did not skimp out on the fish. A lot of fish filets and other additional ingredients. Perfect for cold days.

Cooked intestine with tofu - the pork intestine was sooo good, fresh with strong intestine flavor which I like. Also the egg tofu was very good at neutralizing the spice. Spicy but worth.

We ordered about 6 or 7 different dishes and everything was amazing. My personal favorite were the soup dumplings and the veggie dumplings. We also had pork buns that my friend was crazy about and fell in love with. The restaurant is very intimate and it's not a big place and you can tell they're really busy from all the rustle and bustle that goes on but they deserve it because the food is great.

Let's start with the food and drinks. They have a fantastic selection of items, and specials on the menu.  From escarole soup to steak and lobster. They also have a very enticing dessert tray! I tried the veal piccante. It was very tender and tasted quite lovely. We also tried the langostinas, they were on the specials menu. Also very well prepared, presented, and delicious. All the main dishes are a la carte. Sides include sauteed spinach, mashed potatoes, sauteed escarole, and there was also a brussel sprout side added. There are two bars, one upstairs and one on the main dining area as you walk in. The bars are beautiful and well stocked.  They have a decent wine and cocktail menu.  I decided to try the Vesper, it was very good! 
What's changed? The price of food here is very high! Too high for the area, the type of cuisine (Italian), and for a casual restaurant not known for great cuisine made by well known chefs. There are many top restaurants in the city with comparable pricing, or lower. It would be quite a challenge to dine here again simply based on the very high priced items.  Please take this into consideration! 
Bread.  Not good at all! Our bread came out in a small basket and was frozen in the center. Appeared to have been warmed up very quickly. It was not fresh or tasty.  In fact, this almost ruined my appetite.  I didn't mention this to the server because I had already decided this was not typical or satisfactory; and I didn't really need to eat bread that badly anyway. 
Complementary parking.  They have a couple lots to park at.  They were both full.  However there is a valet that will park your car. He will let you know he works for tips. Be good to him. I would recommend taking a taxi, Uber/Lyft to the restaurant..  It would save you time and the aggravation of driving around trying to find a parking space, or tipping the friendly valet. 
Saloon has beautiful old world decor.  Lots of beautiful carved wood and nice artwork throughout.  To be quite frank, it's a little too busy.  The restaurant is very clean.  The service was very good! Everyone here is well dressed and appeared to enjoy doing their job.  They were very welcoming from entering and leaving. 
Overall, Saloon was a disappointment, despite being a traditional South Philly landmark. I was not happy with the prices here at all. Especially since it was a la carte. I probably won't come back, but I feel you should at least give it a try, take your chances. Be prepared to spend at least $70 or more per person.

Those endorsements all sounded too good to be true when my wife and I were picking a restaurant for a celebratory dinner, but fortunately for us Wm Mulherins lived mostly up to the hype. We snagged a last minute reservation outdoors in the covered street trailer and thankfully snagged the last spot in their adjacent lot on a busy Saturday night. Service ran a little slow initially as the restaurant was slammed, but our waiter ultimately was helpful in menu selection and paced our meal out at a comfortable clip. 

We started with two small plates: the BLT focaccia and the smoked beets. While we appreciated the bacon inflected mayo and the peak summer heirloom tomatoes in the BLT, the focaccia itself ate a little dry. The better received beets carried the perfect amount of smoke and balanced nicely with tangy, funky goat cheese.

Pastas here arrive in relatively small portions, but both the eggplant ravioli and the carbonara were excellent. Each bite had the perfect amount of chew, and the pastas clung on to the delicious sauces well. We initially chose Wm Mulherins for the pasta menu, but the pizzas frankly blew us away. There are a ton of Neapolitan pizza joints in town, but this place served our favorite pies by far. We loved the puffy and soft yet sturdy crusts that possessed the perfect amount of char. Of our selections, we particularly enjoyed the eggplant and Frank White pies. 

While the small plates and pastas are a little speedy, the pizza prices are on par with everywhere else in the city and the pies are a little more filling. As such, Wm Mulherins overall averages out to be fairly reasonable given the quality of food.

Bing Bing's food is amazing. My following comments are from my most recent order, but I've visited 4 or 5 times now and every time is outstanding. 
Food comments - I ordered the Shrimp dumplings (5), and the shrimp itself was very juicy. I really enjoyed these shrimp dumplings, and I eat a lot of shrimp dumplings! The Spicy Sichuan cucumbers (5+) are a must try - they are crunchy, spicy, crisp and just so flavorful. There are times I'm ordering somewhere else, and I will not get the cucumbers, because I know they will not be nearly as good as Bing Bing's. Their cucumbers are one of my favorite food items in the entire city. My most recent main dish was the Jewish Chicken Wonton Noddle Soup (5), and it was surprisingly good. It has thin pieces of doughy crepe which was unique, the wontons were great and the broth was absolutely loaded with flavor. 
Other comments - Their drinks & bar is surprisingly good, too. I note this, because I go for the food, and then am always pleasantly surprised by the drinks. Speaking of drinks, be forewarned, they do not include happy hour specials for to-go or online orders. So, if you can, just go to the restaurant! They have a warm, decorative inside space, as well as covered outdoor tables. Price wise, I'd say it's slightly more expensive than others, but it's not unreasonable.

They have about 6 types of dim sum including chicken dumplings, shrimp, and scarlet dumplings. They have six or seven entrees. We've only had Dan Dan noodles which were very good. We've had most of the appetizers and they're great, although I'd advise you ask what's on the pickle plate for the day since it can vary. The weakness of the menu is they don't have a lot of dim sum options for a place named after dim sum. The scarlet dumplings (the dumpling is red bc it's soaked in beet juice) are the only vegetarian option, and only two types of dumplings are on the happy hour menu.

Drinks: I enjoy the drink selection here. It's a mix of American drinks and a few popular East asian Asian alcohols like sake. I feel the cocktails have gotten weaker over the last year, as restaurant traffic has picked back up. I also paid $15 for a tiny amount of a basic nigori one time and I was kinda floored. I didn't even get a buzz from it. 

Ambiance: They offer indoor and outdoor dining. The indoor area is quite colorful and ""hip"", while outdoors the tables line the sidewalk. The street-adjacent seats are covered and enclosed, and the plants they have out make the area attractive and relaxing. I'd say it's a ""hip"" young crowd and can get somewhat loud. Nigori is easy to come by and this was neither a good portion nor an impressive sip. I have no idea how they justify price per pour. 

Getting a table: While they are usually busy, I've never had to wait. The first couple times I went I was immediately asked if I had a reservation, even when the restaurant was mostly empty. One time I was verbally given a time limit on how long I could sit at my table. Again, the restaurant was not full. I held off on reviewing because this was infuriating and I didn't know if it was an ongoing thing. The hostesses have chilled out quite a bit though and they have been friendlier in the months since that happened. 

Staff: Waitstaff and bar staff are prompt and very nice to interact with.

The menu has great options, is fairly priced, and there is an extensive bar list as well with beer, wine, and cocktails.

I ordered their gin drink called The Gem and the rest of the table got a bottle of white wine. The Gem was delicious if you like gin, citrusy and strong without being overwhelming. It lasted the whole meal and I was pleased. Service was great - our waiter was attentive without being at the table too often.

We ordered the Shanghai soup dumplings, spicy shrimp, spicy pork, shrimp shui mai, and pan fried beef dim sum. My favorite was the shrimp shui mai and Shanghai soup dumplings.They had the best flavor. The soup dumplings are very hot so be forewarned, try to let them cool enough to get the whole thing in your mouth and then pierce the skin. The soup and delicious flavor overtakes your mouth. Very cool. The shrimp shui mai were fantastic and had the best flavor for me. The two spicy options, while good, didn't taste spicy so next time I would just order the regular version and use the crispy chili sauce on them. Least favorite was the beef.

The service felt very much like a Seinfeld episode of the soup Nazi. Very curt, unprofessional, and some yelling at patrons trying to either order or just get a seat.

Food: So this place focuses on big fish pots. Essentially, pick a fish, then add whatever ingredients you want and a sauce, and it comes out in a very lavish plate/bowl. The also had a ton of normal/side dishes you can order as well. We decided to do the pork belly appetizer and mapo tofu, which were both really, really good. The fish looked amazing and tasted good. We decided to have the Hot sauce since they recommended it, which is basically Szechuan. Really tasty! Because it's a pot and you can add whatever you want, it can come out pricey. They do not have a bar, so I suspect you can BYO. 

Environment: Service was good! Open space and the servers can easily see you if you wave them down. We didn't have a solo server; I think any server can take care of any table.

I ordered from here just to try something new & I'm glad I tried it! 
Food: I ordered a Alaska roll (4) a fresh green roll (3.5) & the chow mei fun with shrimp (4). The Alaska roll was fine, but the green roll lessened on me as I ate it - I'm not sure why that was. The mei fun was a little bland to me but still pretty good and a generous portion. Food wise, it's nothing fancy or superb. I'm going to keep it in mind as the Chinese place I keep in mind for a quick fix! 
Other notes: The service/employee greeting me was so kind. I think their prices were exceptionally fair. Two rolls and a big portion of mei fun was less than $20. Lastly, as of now, they are still take out only. I planned to do pick up, but I wanted to mention that for others. My order was ready pretty quick - 20 minutes on a Friday night around 6.

It is a bit pricier than most other hot pot around, fair warning. But in reality, the extra cost is more than fair (I'd even call it a discount) when you consider the great location, the excellent service, the top-quality food, and the ambiance. 

Particularly, for a lot of types of cuisine, I often feel like I have to visit a dank restaurant (think hole-in-the-wall) to find the really good authentic stuff.

An amazing experience overall. I was lucky enough to try a huge variety of their dishes. Emphasizing squashes across all their plates was an interesting take, probably seasonal. 

In the small plates, the Crispy Octopus was my favorite. The flavor wasn't fishy at all and had a very nice fried texture/taste without being too oily. Some of these appetizers were a bit pricey though, especially for veggies. Appreciated the freshness and the creativity though!
 
From the pizzas, the Zucca was life changing... so good. I never would imagine having squash on a pizza to be an experience but it definitely was. The Leslie Chow and the Spicy Jawn were also pretty good! The pizzas are the most worth-their-price for me- huge servings ( of 6 slices) and enough to share family style. Great dough and crust too. 

In the pastas, you just have to try the carbonara. I mean: cheese and pork belly. That's it. The other pastas were fine but nothing insanely special. The Cappellacci was not for me- too sweet/not balanced and more like a dessert than a pasta. Reminded me of pumpkin spice in ravioli form. 

In the wood-fired plates, the Grilled Halibut was my favorite dish of the night. The chanterelle mushrooms, 'in umido' as they put it,  were so tender and soft- reminded me of rendered pork fat. Also a sucker for truffle flavor so that added to the plate immensely.  

Overall, the dining experience was great, with the server being welcoming, patient, and attentive. She was very accommodating and helpful for our vegetarian guests and made sure we all had a nice night. Also, the ambience of the restaurant was pretty traditional for Italian. Wish we could have tried their signature desserts but they ran out by the end of the night. In my opinion, the prices weren't outrageous- there's definitely some affordable dishes that are far worth the price. Props to the cooks.

I also tried the hidden dragon roll which consisted of crab and avocado and topped with salmon, tobiko, scallion and a special sauce.

Wokano is one of my favorite places to get weekend morning dim sum. It's simple, comforting, affordable, and relaxing. It's everything I want in a first-meal of the day. 

If you go a little later in the day or the evening, it fills up quickly. But going in the morning ensures there's likely a table free for you to walk right in and grab. 

There's a very friendly man who walks around making sure you have water, I think he might be the manager or the owner. He's always happy to see returning customers and greets us warmly each time. 

When I go to most places to eat, I like to try something different each time. But I find myself always going for the same items at Wokano. But no matter what you get, make sure to at least get the sesame buns and egg custard buns, and a pot of tea. You can not go wrong with these as part of your order!

It's filling, it's delicious, and it's easy on the wallet. 

I also love that when you sit down, you can eat relatively quickly: people are walking carts around the dining area with the food ready to go for you to select and enjoy. 

My only issue is that, unless you live nearby and can walk there, I recommend you take a cab or rideshare. The shopping center parking lot is mayhem. It's packed with a food market and other stores in a small condensed area, so navigating your car in that parking lot is an endurance challenge.

I'm done talking about the food now.  I want to discuss hospitality.  Since the start of the pandemic, I felt we had to help local businesses and restaurants.  Over the almost two-year period now, I've understood and told people that it's not about the diners dining experience.  There is always a staff shortage, a long wait, and it's not about us.  It's about keeping these places alive. Some are good places, some are bad.  I've been to Ocean City, Maryland on vacation, weddings, and other places that just had poor dining experiences.  Tonight was the first time I felt truly back.  Almost like how it was before.  

We arrived at Wm Mulherin's Sons without a reservation.  I can't remember the last time we dined without one.  The hostess looked over the computer and I assumed it would be a long wait if they could even help me.  They said it would be about ten minutes and to wait in the vestibule.  Wow...  It was probably five minutes at most...  We were seated in the pizza room and our attentive server helped us make our choices.  This was the first time in a while I've seen more than one server.  In fact, plenty of people were assisting us.  In one instance, someone cleared our empty glasses and asked if they could get us another one if we haven't already been helped.

The place is cute, I'm not gonna lie. I see why people like this place, there's a vibe and the outdoor seating is cute if the weather is nice but seriously don't come hungry unless you want to order the whole menu. Me and 3 of my friends went on a Thursday evening for a 7:15 reservation. I was really excited to try this place and I thought I was going to be obsessed, instead I left unimpressed.  

Fried Wonton chips $8 - the wonton chips were great but who doesn't like fried anything? The 3 salsa or what they call salsa was just that. Where's the flavor? 

Duck Egg Roll $9 - Don't waste your money. Where's the duck? $9 for 1 egg roll ???!!! Not worth it. I know we are experiencing surging prices but seriously? $1.50 veggie or pork egg roll  at any corner Chinese restaurant beats this overpriced fried mess! 

Octopus Tostado $14- it was alright but we were hungry so we ate it. It really lacked flavor. Decent amount of octopus on it. 

Lo Mein $15 add chicken + $4 =$19 It wasn't bad but I wasn't great and for that price, it was not worth it. The added chicken was the best part, nicely seasoned, tender with a crunch. The sesame oil was over powering leaving an after taste. 

Marinated Skirt Steak $22 - soy ginger marinated? More like soy sauce marinated, it was missing something. Again, nothing to celebrate about. It just does not live up to what you are paying. Make your own at home with Kikkoman soy sauce, it would more than likely taste better. It was cooked medium and tender so we give it that. It came with a bowl of over cooked white rice. I know my rice and this was over cooked that the grain exploded on its way to becoming a rice pop. 

Quesabirria Tacos $17 - we cancelled this order. It took too long, the rain was starting and we were sitting outside. Cancelling was probably the best decision we made! 

Drinks
We ordered 3 margaritas and 1 mezcal margarita, for $11 a pop, again, not worth it. 

Overall, you don't really get Mexican flavors, I feel like the Asian taste despite lack of flavors overall comes through more. I see their concept but the flavors did not fully transfer into the food. 

Again, it's not about the price but for these prices you should be getting something worth the money. All we left with was a pricey bill for a meager amount of food that had you questioning your choices in life. 

It wasn't the servers fault, she was fine and we left 20% tip but I think she knew we weren't impressed with the food. We literally went back to my friend's house and threw popcorn shrimp in the air fryer and made cocktails to forget about wasting our money and time.",La Chinesca,19123,"{'RestaurantsReservations': 'True', 'RestaurantsTakeOut': 'True', 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': 'True', 'WheelchairAccessible': 'True', 'BusinessParking': ""{u'valet': False, u'garage': None, u'street': None, u'lot': None, u'validated': False}"", 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '2', 'RestaurantsTableService': 'True', 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'HappyHour': 'True', 'Alcohol': ""u'full_bar'"", 'Ambience': ""{u'divey': None, u'hipster': None, u'casual': True, u'touristy': None, u'trendy': True, u'intimate': None, u'romantic': None, u'classy': None, u'upscale': None}"", 'OutdoorSeating': 'True', 'RestaurantsDelivery': 'True', 'GoodForMeal': ""{u'breakfast': None, u'brunch': None, u'lunch': None, u'dinner': True, u'latenight': None, u'dessert': None}"", 'HasTV': 'False'}","Nightlife, Bars, Chinese, New Mexican Cuisine, Restaurants",0.126282196969697,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,La Chinesca,19123,North,0.126282196969697,0.9907,0.126282196969697

Scallion pancakes - too doughy and not crispy. Overpriced. But to be honest, all of the small plates are. Only the noodles and soup seem reasonable.

Soup dumplings - best thing we tried. Flavorful and decent size.

Sticky rice - tiny and barely any filling. Sausage tasted good though.

Garlic wings - insanely disappointing. $6 for 4 wings that are bland and have no flavor besides the faint whiff of curry powder. They felt like the frozen wing dings they serve at corner stores.

Dan Dan noodles - okay. The chili oil here is one of the best things about it.

Short rib ramen - this came out 25 mins after everything else. At this point we were scared of being disappointed again and were hoping the waitress wouldn't bring it.

- If they have reservations, make it well in advance. 
- There are INDIVIDUAL and FAMILY options, ask them what's available and what you prefer. 
- If you're allergic to lemon, TELL THEM. They only serve lemon water & the ponzu sauce has lemon. 
- If you like EDM, this is the place for you--that's all they play  and it's even louder in the bathroom. 
- Entry level spice is still spicy even if you're experienced with spice, so be careful. 
- They no longer have a liquor license so it's only BYOB. 
- Heaven & Hell soup is family style only. 
- There is a time limit of your stay: 1.5 hours. 
- There's a promotion if you've waited for 1+ hours but TELL YOUR SERVER so they can reflect that on your check. 
- The menu is virtual only and it is not user-friendly at all. The interface makes it hard to zoom and scroll. And when you do zoom in to look closer, the text is very pixelated/not clear and is hard to read. 
- Tables/chairs are not very ergonomic and makes the experience more difficult than it needs to be--if the chairs were higher, the reach for grabbing & cooking will be much easier. The restaurant is not very accessible either. 

Now back to the main program...
THE WAIT & MISCOMMUNICATION: We were looking forward to coming here for hotpot on a cold day. But we didn't expect it the wait to be so long. We walked in and the wait was 2+ hours with poor communication as we had to keep refreshing the Yelp waitlist and texting the person to figure out when our table was ready.  And the miscommunication continued as we sat down. They seated us at a table for individual hotpots but when we ordered Heaven & Hell soup, they told us that was only family style. We assumed it would be family style bc that's what hotpot usually is. It turns out that there was room at the family style table, and our wait probably could've been shorter if they communicated that this was an option. 
They gave us water but didn't communicate that it was lemon water so we were concerned and confused why there was stuff in the water--they still didn't clarify when we told them something was in it.

THE FOOD: Although everything was disgustingly overpriced, the soup was so yummy! The HEAVEN AND HELL soup was half original and half spicy (entry level was still spicy!!). Both were so savory and had depth, would come just to drink the soup (LOL). My opinion is that eating hotpot outside is always a ripoff--you can easily buy your own ingredients at such a cheaper price, maybe not as high quality meats as restaurants provide. There are hotpot soup bases that you can buy at Asian grocery stores but I'm sure it won't be as good as here or made from scratch. All the ingredients outside of the meats were what you would expect. The protein we got were: PORK BELLY, WAGYU SHORT RIB WITH EGG, LAMB SHANK, RIB EYE, FISH FILLET, and TIGER SHRIMP. They all were yummy especially with the soups. The best was tiger shrimp! The Wagyu short rib with egg wasn't really worth the price; the meat was super tender and melt-in-mouth but the egg didn't really add much to the experience. 

THE SERVICE: Our server was Kitty and she was very helpful! Outside of the general miscommunication of the entire staff, she was friendly throughout our time there. 
I think they know how bad their wait times are so they actually have a promotion for a free protein dish if you've waited for 1+ hours. We had to tell Kitty that we wanted to use that promotion--so if you waited, make sure you tell your server! Because we waited for 2+ hours, Kitty gave us 2 free protein dishes, which was very nice!

THE WHEEL: They're currently doing a promotion for their 3rd year anniversary to write a review and spin a wheel for a coupon. I was already in the process of writing my review when she told us about the promotion. But beware the wheel is very obviously rigged. It slowed down near the $50 coupon & Wagyu beef but you saw the wheel spin again as if there was a weight that pulled it away. It was so obviously rigged it was funny. We got a free drink... yippie. They don't even have alcohol so the free drink is a soda/tea/something cheap. 

Wow this is the longest review I've ever written but I hope it encapsulates the best picture of my experience. All in all, I don't think I would return because of the price and poor wait-time and communication. I think they have a lot of room to grow, especially with the interior. But if you're looking to treat yourself with good soup on a cold day, just make sure you're making reservations (if they have the option) or getting ahead with the wait list.

There was no shortage of hype preceding La Chinesca's arrival to Philly. And at night, you can't miss the red neon sign illuminating the corner of Spring Garden and 11th. Vibes at the restaurant are just as popping as the lights. The spacious front patio features picnic bench-style seating, ideal for warm evenings. The industrial indoor space hosts plenty of small tables, streetlight-style lighting fixtures, and a wide bar. The back room is crafted from 2 repurposed shipping containers behind the original Jiffy Lube structure. Music and chatter echo moderately loudly against the metal walls. Mood lighting accentuates the knickknacks around the restaurant, each paying homage to the automotive industry.

My partner and I arrived at the tail end of Friday Happy Hour, and the indoor space was full. To our surprise, the HH menu consisted of only a handful of drink options and no food specials. We quickly ordered 2 cocktails, the Spark Plug and the Spiked Agua Fresca, before perusing the food menu.

We decided on the Fried Wonton Chips, the Salt & Pepper Squid Caesar, the Scallion Pancakes (a nightly special), and the Quesabirria Tacos. Our tiny table was quickly decked by the former 3 dishes. The chip platter was piled with a mountain of wonton chips. The chips themselves were nicely salted and flavorful on their own, decidedly better than standard corn chips. Further, they sturdily held up well to the dips. Of the salsa, we most enjoyed the light and fresh salsa verde, and the autumnal pumpkin and sesame salsa. The Caesar salad was comprised of standard romaine lettuce and a stingy portion of squid. However, the dressing was robustly salty and savory, better even than most premium Caesar dressings. The scallion pancake platter hosted 3 CD-sized cakes, each topped with a healthy dollop of pickled veggies. The thin, single-layered pancakes ended up dry without a dedicated dipping sauce on the side. Some time after we finished our first dishes, our piping hot, clearly cooked-to-order tacos were brought out. Each taco was hefty and generously stuffed with slightly overcooked braised beef and a layer of melty chihuahua cheese. The tortilla shell was slightly limp, exacerbated when dipping it into the flavorful, umami consomme. To round out our meal, we were surprised by an order of Churros on the house! The dessert plate was large overall, with 5 medium-sized pieces, each crisp and doused in cinnamon sugar. Alone, the churros were somewhat bland, but that was quickly fixed by the thick, silky dark chocolate-mezcal sauce.

Throughout our meal, the service was quick and helpful. Overall, dishes felt glaringly safe -- either Mexican or Chinese cuisine, rather than committing fully to fusion. Our $82 bill (after tax and tip) felt ~$5 overpriced per person. In particular, the drinks seemed overpriced, even after the HH special, for relatively standard quality and quantity.

To be honest, I only picked the place because I thought the name was funny but it turned out to be one of the best hot pot places I've ever eaten at (probably the best for me)!

I tried to get put on the Yelp waitlist for 5 pm on a Thursday night, but it wasn't open until I decided to walk over to Chubby Castle and it opened 20 minutes later; it said it'd be an 1 hour and a half wait for 4 people in front of me. I checked with the front person at the restaurant too and just hung out at a place in Chinatown to pass time. I was able to get seated within an hour instead when they called me to let me know that, which was great. The front person and the waitress for our table were very kind and attentive.

Everyone gets their own personal pot of soup base, which I'm not typically used to. I ordered the medium spicy pot - I could tell it was spicy from the broth and pepper but I guess I'm too used to spicy food to feel threatened by it. I ordered some of the wagyu cuts and then the pork belly, but my favourite was definitely the wagyu brisket - so flavourful and the texture was great alongside the spicy pot! I think the meats tasted very high quality and delicate at the same time. They also give you this huge tray of sauces/herbs you can use to dip meats in, but I didn't really know what to make so I just left it alone. They give you their signature sauce to dip the meats in too, so I just used that and it was delicious. 

Overall, I think the prices are worth the quality and taste of the meats, as well as the experience of the place. The place is small, but the staff are attentive and there's a conveyor belt inside if you want to get some items like veggies, certain meats, or other sides (but they're a little pricey in my opinion... it's like $5 for a head of lettuce). 

I really loved this place and it's definitely a place I need to revisit if I'm ever back in the Center City area.

From what we saw, either the food was overpriced or the servings didn't meet the exceptions set by the price. Rice was free but it was served in the smallest rice bowl I have ever seen in my life.

The way it's decorated and the purple light gives it the 90s vibe. It's not a modern restaurant by any means. This place is located in China Town and I highly highly recommend Ubering or taking a taxi as there is literally no parking here.

I ordered a variety of foods such as a variety plate that had beef slices, clam, intestine, jellyfish and some cured meat. I would say that this was not good at all. The jelly fish reminded me of the jelly fish you find at the grocery store for like 2 dollars. It's bland and it seems like they forgot to mix the sauce with it. The beef was really dry and tough. The intestines is a weird touch as that's not usually on this kind of platter and the best thing was probably the cured meat as that is probably something they bought instead of making it in-house. 

The braised tofu tasted decent. The sauce goes great with white rice (which you need to order). The snow peas are correctly prepared as the ends are cut off and the fiber strip was taken off. The beef chow fun tasted good, very traditional style and it was well seasoned. The beef was tender and easy to eat. The snow pea leaf was just okay as well. It's weird as it's sold by market price and not a fixed price.

Portion sizing is good, plenty of food but the beef chow fun didn't have many beef pieces. Some of these dishes are priced moderately well. Service here wasn't so good. It took a few tries to get something like napkins and we had to keep asking about the white rice.

The cleanliness of the restaurant is... questionable. It looks pretty run down and the bathroom is really really disgusting. It's really small like a standing shower and there's water everywhere (at least I hope it's water). 

Overall, just a mediocre Chinese restaurant. Would I recommend? Only if you're really hungry and there's not many places opened.

Meals - I tried their dumpling sampler. Awesome choice and love the homemade chili oil.

The Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soup was SO worth it. Again a bit on the pricey side I know BUT try it at least once! (And then come back for more..)

For now, we have been there for a good number of times. 

Parking: They have their own decent size parking lot so there's no need to look for street parking. 

Location: The restaurant is located very close to the Philadelphia Mills, aka Franklin Mills.

Services: Employees were nice. They check on you throughout your meal or are available when you need them. 

Covid: All employees are masks on. They do tried to sit you apart from other customers if you requested. Most customers are sitting at the booth on the side back to back from other booth. 

Food: Pho taste not bad, at a good average level. Sometimes I do feel the soup broth might be slightly a bit salty, but overall not bad at all. Around the upper Northeast area near Bensalem, the food quality is consider pretty good. Portion wise maybe a tad bit small compare to other Vietnamese or pho restaurants.

Price: Their price are consider on the high end but not the ridiculous price I have seen at other locations. It is still acceptable. Maybe because I'm paying this price, I might expect a bit more out.

We were a party of 6 celebrating my friend's engagement. We all ordered a drink, appetizers, and a couple of us shared multiple appetizers or entrees. The waiter (bald older man) kept trying to push the $60 per person tasting menu on us- which, while it seems amazing, isn't what we were looking for on our medical school student budgets- we wanted nice food, but not quite that pricy.

After we ordered the waiter was clearly irritated we hadn't ordered more and proceeded to ignore our table the remainder of the night. He went and took drink orders and refilled the water at the two large party tables beside us (twice) but ignored us  completely and never refilled our water after we put our order in (probably at least an hour). The previous hour while we'd had drinks and waited for our friend this had not been the case. We would have liked to have order more drinks, but after being ignored for that long decided not to and to just get the check because we were tired of the staff looking down their noses at us. 

In addition to that, the food was far from original in my opinion, and nothing to justify the price point. Sure some of the appetizers were unique, and the duck was delicious, but I don't think they were any better than what I've had at any other Philly dim sum restaurant or Asian fusion restaurants (and was considerably more expensive).

They only serve Shanghainese dumplings and snacks, so you came here craving cantonese dimsum stamples like cheung fun or turnip cake or a legit hargow you will be disappointed. 

Looking around their consistently crowded dining room the most popular items are by far dumplings of all kinds - soup dumplings, potstickers, sheng jian bao - and scallion pancakes. 

The scallion pancake doesn't look particularly good and seems overpriced, so I've never tried it. We've tried almost all the dumpling options at least twice over several occasions though, both there and for delivery, and.. it's alright.

The xiao long bao are particularly underwhelming. The skin is really thick, the filling not very flavorful. Not a delicate purse bursting with umami like you would hope or crave. The rest of the dumplings are fine, but doesn't really live up to the hype or is any better than elsewhere. It tastes like something mass manufactured you could order, like frozen fries out of a box. Very comforting, very generic, but you expect more from a place that specializes in dumplings.

The rest of the dishes are also just okay. Not memorable, not enjoyable, but not completely offensive in taste either? Like I wouldn't have eaten here again after any of the times I've tried it had I not known it was ""supposed to be good.""

Maybe this place just doesn't cater to an asian palate. Most of the clientele here is not Asian, and they seem to enjoy it here. Not really the type of dim sum or kinds of dishes I expect or necessarily want to eat though.

All the dishes were aesthetically pleasing (excluding the conveyer belt items). The conveyer belt is a cool aspect although I'm unsure of its necessity here.

I'd recommend coming here with a small party of up to four people. However, I would not recommend for large groups. For this reason and my personal experience thus far, I have to give 3 stars.

Service in detail: Our server was very kind despite offering a drink option and not delivering on it.

I've been here a couple of times per covid and it was fine and not sure what happened but it's absolutely a place to avoid now. We got 5 dishes the wait took a long time, the quality was so bad and the portion size was so small compared to the price that we paid. For reference I am Cantonese and know what these dishes taste like if they were made properly. 

The first was the pineapple fried rice and it was so sad. They used canned pineapples but they didn't even look diced like they straight up poured it out the can, strained it, and threw it in fried rice. It didn't come in a pineapple (which I supposed makes sense if they don't use real pineapple but comon the picture had a pineapple isn't it false advertising at this point). The flavor was also really unimpressive. 

The garlic pea leaves we got were supposed to be stir fried but they BOILED it. There was no flavor at all. I can't believe they boiled it.. either they are super short staffed in the kitchen or they absolutely don't care anymore. Nothing on the pictures look like that came on the table. 

The Dan Dan noodle portion was so small. The flavor was okay but overall not good and wouldn't get again. 

The dry pot chicken was also sad. The coating And the chicken didn't mix well at all. And the texture was all wrong. I'm not sure how they messed this up but they really did. It was also really really salty. 

The chongqin noodles were okay. Not a super huge fan but the portion size was also really small.

I'd imagine that most things were previously canned or is able to keep in a freezer for more than a year without spoiling. So items like little sausages, quail eggs, and fish tofu. Paying $1+ per mini-sausage or fish tofu seemed not quite a good deal. Side note: the handmade noodles arrive in one-biters.

Soup base is alright and waygu/beef was very nice, albeit with a price markup. When you order, the waiter/tress will haul over a tray full of sauces and condiments which is really cool, except for the fact that it was all open to the air and also during Covid season.

I came across this place by chance when a friend, who was visiting the area, expressed a craving for noodle soup and found this place on Yelp. Ever since, it's been a frequented place. Every time I go, it seems to be more packed than the last visit, which attests to their popularity. 

Food and Drink Ordered:
* worth trying

- [Scallion Pancake*]: A friend told me that Nan Zhou Hand Drawn Noodle House has the best scallion pancakes and I can wholeheartedly agree. Crisp to perfection and a complementary dipping sauce.

- [Spicy Pig Ears*]: Hands down the best place to get pig ears. I like how thin they slice the pig ear and the pickled veggies underneath make this combination a delicious duo. 

- [Beef Brisket Hand Drawn Noodle Soup*]: I would choose the hand drawn noodles over the shaved noodles. They are pretty generous with the portions so I would recommend sharing a bowl or taking the rest to go if you don't usually eat a lot. You can reheat it by heating up the soup separate from the noodles and then put the noodles into the heated up soup.

Essentially it is a meal where you put all the ingredients into a hot stone bowl yourself (no gas for the bowl). They give you all the add-ins and for the most part what they give you is standard (although I didn't try and ask for anything extra/substitutions, the staff was so nice I'm sure they would if you ask!). I ordered the classic bowl and asked for some chili oil to give it a little spice. I thought the broth was very flavorful without being overly/unnecessarily salty.

One can't help but be impressed with how clean and pretty this Panda Express is, especially you've seen this location in its previous, dingy McDonald's incarnation.

The main issue I have with this Panda Express is that a number of food options are not available for we pre-noon lunch folk. I'll stop by around 11:30am (typically considered to be time for prime lunch hours), and I haven't been able to get various sides or entrees--serving dishes are empty, even for something basic like vegetables.

I haven't been to other Panda Express locations to compare with this location, and I'm not a Panda manager (who probably knows when to stock the counter with which options that sell best), but it's just a bit disappointing to an occasional customer like myself to have their choices feel limited.

I was so excited since there aren't great dim sum options where I'm from. We ordered the shrimp dumplings, siu mai, pork bun (cha siu bao), fried dough in cheung fun (炸兩), custard bun (流沙包), fried shrimp balls! My favorite was probably the custard bun, fried shrimp balls, and the siu mai was up there too. All the buns were super fluffy and everything came out steaming hot! Prices were not bad either! I didn't like the cha siu bao / pork bun bc it was actually huge and the flavor inside was overpowered by the onions and it wasn't as sweet as usual. The shrimp in the shrimp dumplings was not that flavorful but the skin was chewy! Fried shrimp balls were surprisingly really good - it was crunchy and flavorful! We had also ordered soup dumplings but they had missed it so we just cancelled it and it was all good!!
